	abstract = {The bulk properties of tropical cloud clusters, such as the vertical mass flux, the excess temperature, and moisture and the liquid water content of the clouds, are determined from a combination of 1) the observed large-scale heat and moisture budgets over an area covering the cloud cluster, and 2) a model of a cumulus ensemble which exchanges mass, heat, water vapor and liquid water with the environment through entrainment and detrainment. The method also provides an understanding of how the environmental air is heated and moistened by the cumulus convection. An estimate of the average cloud cluster properties and the heat and moisture balance of the environment, obtained from 1956 Marshall Islands data, is presented.},

	abstract = {Rawinsonde, surface, and satellite data collected from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) are used to investigate the distributions of beating, moistening, precipitation, and evaporation over the western Pacific warm pool. The behavior of the atmosphere and the response of the ocean surface before, during, and after the passages of westerly wind bursts are examined. The tropospheric vertical wind shear associated with tropical low-frequency oscillations strongly modulated convective beating and moistening. Heavy precipitation usually fell 1 to 3 weeks prior to the peak westerly wind bursts. SSTs reached their maximum during the undisturbed phase of the intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs), gradually decreased as convection intensified, and reached their minimum during the periods of peak westerly winds when deep convection was generally suppressed over the intensive flux array (IFA). Surface latent heat fluxes were positively correlated with surface wind speed and varied between 50 and 100 W m−2 during light winds to more than 200 W m−2 during strong westerly wind bursts. Surface sensible heat fluxes, however, did not follow the pattern of surface wind speed and usually peaked during organized deep convection over the IFA. Intensive observing period (IOP)-mean evaporation and sensible heat flux over the large-scale array (LSA) were obtained by adjusting the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fields toward buoy estimates over the IFA. These values were then used to determine IOP-mean rainfall distribution over the LSA from the moisture budget. The results generally compare well with two satellite remote-sensing estimations, SSM/I retrievals and GPI, and the ECMWF model forecast. All four methods indicate an east-west zone of minimal rainfall along the equator. Two heavy rainfall bands coinciding with the double-ITCZ structure were located north and south of the equator. The IFA was mainly located within the minimum rainfall band. Budget-diagnosed rainfall rates over the IFA agree with SSM/I retrievals, but the GPI values are excessive, particularly at times of extensive cirrus. Comparison of the apparent heat source Q1 profiles suggests that the long-term mean heating rates over the warm pool have large positive values at all levels of the atmosphere and peak between 400 and 450 hPa. In contrast, the apparent moisture sink Q2 profiles show distinctly different features over the warm pool. Positive values (indicating drying) exist in the ITCZ bands north and south of the IFA. However, low-level moistening is evident in the profiles over the IFA, probably due to strong evaporation and upward transport of moisture by shallow cumuli during high winds.},

	abstract = {We construct, analyze, and implement a new nonoscillatory high-resolution scheme for two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. The scheme is a predictor-corrector method which consists of two steps: starting with given cell averages, we first predict pointvalues which are based on nonoscillatory piecewise-linear reconstructions from the given cell averages; at the second corrector step, we use staggered averaging, together with the predicted midvalues, to realize the evolution of these averages. This results in a second-order, nonoscillatory central scheme, a natural extension of the one-dimensional second-order central scheme of Nessyahu and Tadmor [J. Comput. Phys., 87 (1990), pp. 408--448].As in the one-dimensional case, the main feature of our two-dimensional scheme is simplicity. In particular, this central scheme does not require the intricate and time-consuming (approximate) Riemann solvers which are essential for the high-resolution upwind schemes; in fact, even the computation of the exact Jacobians can be avoided. Moreover, the central scheme is "genuinely multidimensional" in the sense that it does not necessitate dimensional splitting.We prove that the scheme satisfies the scalar maximum principle, and in the more general context of systems, our proof indicates that the scheme is positive (in the sense of Lax and Liu [CFD Journal, 5 (1996), pp. 1--24]). We demonstrate the application of our central scheme to several prototype two-dimensional Euler problems. Our numerical experiments include the resolution of shocks oblique to the computational grid; they show how our central scheme solves with high resolution the intricate wave interactions in the so-called double Mach reflection problem [J. Comput. Phys., 54 (1988), pp.  115--173]  without following the characteristics; and finally we report on the accurate ray solutions of a weakly hyperbolic system [J. Comput. Appl. Math., 74 (1996), pp. 175--192], rays which otherwise are missed by the dimensional splitting approach. Thus, a considerable amount of simplicity and robustness is gained while achieving stability and high resolution.},

	abstract = {Moist convection plays a leading role in the dynamics and energy budget of Earth's tropics and influences the sensitivity of Earth's climate to greenhouse gas increases. Because individual convective cells are much smaller than the gridboxes of 3-dimensional global climate models (GCMs), these models parameterize the effects of an ensemble of moist convective updrafts and downdrafts on the environment. Cumulus parameterization has been a focus of the terrestrial meteorology community for half a century. Only in past decade, however, have GCMs with moist convective physics been applied to other planets. Given our lack of detailed knowledge about convective clouds except on Earth, planetary GCMs are often designed with very simple approaches to cumulus parameterization, adopted from the earliest generations of terrestrial GCMs. These parameterizations were based on breakthroughs in understanding of convection in their time. However, at the same time that planetary GCMs have begun to emerge, a quiet revolution in how we think about terrestrial convection has started to influence the design of terrestrial GCMs. In this paper we review how some of the assumptions in the classical cumulus parameterizations used in planetary GCMs (and still in some terrestrial GCMs) have given way in recent years to a deeper understanding of how convection operates and why it matters for atmospheric dynamics and climate - on any planet.},

The framework, called unified parameterization, effectively unifies the parameterizations in general circulation models (GCMs) and cloud-resolving models (CRMs) and thus is applicable to any horizontal resolution between those typically used in those models. The key parameter in the unification is the fractional convective cloudiness σ, which is the fractional area covered by convective updrafts in the grid cell. The central issue of Part I is to formulate the σ dependence of vertical eddy transports of thermodynamic variables and to determine σ for each realization of grid-scale processes. The present paper completes the formulation through further analysis of the simulated data. The analyzed fields include the vertical structure of the σ dependence of vertical and horizontal eddy transports of moist static energy and horizontal momentum and that of cloud microphysical sources. For the momentum transport, the analysis results clearly show the limits of the traditional approach of parameterization based on an effectively one-dimensional model. For cloud microphysical conversions, it is shown that those taking place primarily inside and outside the updrafts are roughly proportional to σ and 1 − σ, respectively.},

It is pointed out that the key parameter in the generalization is σ, which is the fractional area covered by convective updrafts in the grid cell. Practically all conventional cumulus parameterizations assume σ ≪ 1, at least implicitly, using the gridpoint values of the thermodynamic variables to define the thermal structure of the cloud environment. The proposed framework, called “unified parameterization,” eliminates this assumption from the beginning, allowing a smooth transition to an explicit simulation of cloud-scale processes as the resolution increases. If clouds and the environment are horizontally homogeneous with a top-hat profile, as is widely assumed in the conventional parameterizations, it is shown that the σ dependence of the eddy transport is through a simple quadratic function. Together with a properly chosen closure, the unified parameterization determines σ for each realization of grid-scale processes. The parameterization can also provide a framework for including stochastic parameterization. The remaining issues include parameterization of the in-cloud eddy transport because of the inhomogeneous structure of clouds.},

This idealized configuration makes the problem accessible to high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations without small-scale parameterizations of the turbulence for extended layers with aspect ratios up to 64. Our study is focused on the frequently observed conditionally unstable environment that is stably stratified for unsaturated air, but is unstable for cloudy air. We find that no sharp threshold for the transition to convective turbulence exists, a situation similar to wall-bounded shear flows. Rather, the transition depends on the amplitude of the initial perturbation of the quiescent equilibrium and on the aspect ratio of the convective domain. In contrast to the classical dry Rayleigh–Bénard case, convection is highly asymmetric with respect to the vertical direction. Moist upwelling air inside turbulent cloud aggregates is surrounded by ambient regions of slowly descending unsaturated air. It is also found that conditionally unstable moist convection is inefficient at transporting energy. Our study suggests that there is an upper bound on the Nusselt number in moist convection that is lower than that of the classical dry case.},

The dominant forcing functions are found as solutions of a Lyapunov equation and the response functions are found as the distinct solutions of a related Lyapunov equation. Neither the forcing nor the response functions can be identified with the normal modes of the linearized dynamical operator. High variance levels are sustained in these systems under stochastic forcing, largely by transfer of energy from the mean flow to the perturbation field, despite the exponential stability of all normal modes of the system. From the perspective of modal analysis the explanation for this amplification of variance can be traced to the non‐normality of the linearized dynamical operator. The great amplification of perturbation variance found for Couette and Poiseuille flow implies a mechanism for producing and sustaining high levels of variance in shear flows from relatively small intrinsic or extrinsic forcing disturbances.},

In this study, we have evaluated and quantified the relationship between commonly used closure variables and convection for a range of global climate model (GCM) horizontal resolutions, taking convective precipitation and mass flux at 600 hPa as measures for deep convection. We have used cloud-resolving model simulation data to create domain averages representing GCM horizontal resolutions of 128 km, 64 km, 32 km, 16 km, 8 km, and 4 km. Lead-lag correlation analysis shows that except moisture convergence and turbulent kinetic energy, none of the other closure variables evaluated in this study show any relationship with convection for the six subdomain sizes. It is found that the correlation between moisture convergence and convective precipitation is largest when moisture convergence leads convection. This correlation weakens as the subdomain size decreases to 8 km or smaller. Although convective precipitation and mass flux increase with moisture convergence at a given subdomain size, as the subdomain size increases, the rate at which they increase becomes smaller. This suggests that moisture convergence-based closure should scale down the predicted mass flux for a given moisture convergence as GCM resolution increases.},

(hereafter WKR) put forth a theory that squall-line strength and longevity was most sensitive to the strength of the component of low-level (0–3 km AGL) ambient vertical wind shear perpendicular to squall-line orientation. An “optimal” state was proposed by RKW, based on the relative strength of the circulation associated with the storm-generated cold pool and the circulation associated with the ambient shear, whereby the deepest leading edge lifting and most effective convective retriggering occurred when these circulations were in near balance. Since this work, subsequent studies have brought into question the basic validity of the proposed optimal state, based on concerns as to the appropriate distribution of shear relative to the cold pool for optimal lifting, as well as the relevance of such concepts to fully complex squall lines, especially considering the potential role of deeper-layer shears in promoting system strength and longevity. In the following, the basic interpretations of the RKW theory are reconfirmed and clarified through both the analysis of a simplified two-dimensional vorticity–streamfunction model that allows for a more direct interpretation of the role of the shear in controlling the circulation around the cold pool, and through an analysis of an extensive set of 3D squall-line simulations, run at higher resolution and covering a larger range of environmental shear conditions than presented by WKR.},

	abstract = {For numerical weather prediction with primitive equations (the Eulerian hydrodynamic equations modified by the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium), various coordinate systems are used to represent the vertical structure of the atmosphere. In this paper, we review the essential features of prediction equations, satisfying the conservation of mass and total energy, in various vertical coordinate systems. We formulate the equations of horizontal motion, hydrostatic balance, mass continuity, and thermodynamics using a generalized vertical coordinate in which any variable that gives a single-valued monotonic relationship with a geometric height can be used as a vertical coordinate. Conditions to conserve total energy in a generalized vertical coordinate are investigated. Various prediction schemes using pressure, height, and potential temperature as a vertical coordinate are derived from the set of basic equations in the generalized coordinate system. These three coordinate systems are unique in that the features of prediction equations in each system are all distinct. We place special emphasis on handling the earth's orography as the lower boundary condition. As an extension of the original idea of Phillips applied to the pressure-coordinate system, we propose transformed height and isentropic systems. In those systems, both the top of the model atmosphere and the earth's surface are always coordinate surfaces. It is hoped that these new schemes, as in the case of the Phillips' sigma-system, will enable us to handle the effect of the earth's orography in the prediction models without lengthy coding logic.},

The general model consists of two interlocked systems: a mesoscale parameterization of organized convection and a two-layer model of large-scale equatorial dynamics. The lower-layer dynamics is Rossby gyre–like, whereas outflow from organized convection maintains the upper-layer circulation. The transports of zonal momentum in the vertical and meridional directions are key processes. An archetype of the general model, in spite of being brutally simplified, represents the convective organization, momentum transport, and equatorial superrotation realized by the cloud-resolving convection parameterization or superparameterization explicit approach developed by Grabowski. The mesoscale parameterization is an analytic equivalent of the cloud-system-resolving models used in this computational approach.

	abstract = {The largest convective clouds are mesoscale convective systems, which account for a large portion of Earth's cloud cover and precipitation, and the patterns of wind and weather associated with mesoscale convective systems are important local phenomena that often must be forecast on short timescales. They often produce floods. Mesoscale convective systems are generally much larger than the individual cumulonimbus and lines of cumulonimbus discussed in Chapter 8. They develop circulations on the mesoscale, which are larger in scale than the updrafts and downdrafts of individual cumulonimbus clouds. The mesoscale circulations produce large regions of stratiform (nimbostratus) precipitation of the type discussed in Chapter 6. Often the stratiform precipitation regions trail a squall line consisting of convective cells, and a mesoscale convective vortex tends to form in the stratiform region. The heating profile in the stratiform region is positive at upper levels and negative at lower levels due to evaporation and melting of the precipitation particles. The dynamics of mesoscale circulations involve a joint adjustment to the wind shear and thermodynamic stratification of the large scale environment. Gravity-wave dynamics also contribute to the maintenance of mesoscale convective systems. This chapter reviews both the observed structure of mesoscale systems and their unique dynamics.},

At criticality, order-parameter fluctuations diverge and their spatial correlation decays as a power law. In systems where the tuning parameter and order parameter are coupled, the critical point can become an attractor, and self-organized criticality (SOC) results. Here we argue, using satellite data, that a critical value of water vapour (the tuning parameter) marks a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition to a regime of strong atmospheric convection and precipitation (the order parameter)—with correlated regions on scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres. Despite the complexity of atmospheric dynamics, we find that important observables conform to the simple functional forms predicted by the theory of critical phenomena. In meteorology the term 'quasi-equilibrium' refers to a balance between slow large-scale driving processes and rapid release of buoyancy by moist convection. Our study indicates that the attractive quasi-equilibrium state, postulated long before SOC (ref. 5), is the critical point of a continuous phase transition and is thus an instance of SOC.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that observations of tropical precipitation conform to properties associated with critical phenomena in other systems. Here some of these universal properties are used to probe the physics of tropical convection empirically, providing potential tests for models and parameterizations. The power-law pickup of ensemble average precipitation as a function of column water vapor w occurs above a critical value wc whose temperature dependence is determined for layer-integrated tropospheric temperature or saturation value. This dependence differs from the simplest expectations based on column saturation. Rescaling w by wc permits a collapse of precipitation-related statistics to similar functional dependence for all temperatures. The sharp precipitation variance peak at wc, obtained without detailed vertical structure information, appears consistent with arguments that onset requires a deep moist layer. Sea surface temperature (SST) is found not to have a significant effect on the precipitation pickup. The effect of SST on the climatological precipitation occurs via the frequency of occurrence of w values as the system spends a larger fraction of time near criticality over regions of warm SST. Near and above criticality, where most precipitation occurs, the w distribution is highly constrained by the interaction with convection, with a characteristic sharp drop at criticality. For precipitating points, the distribution has a Gaussian core with an approximately exponential tail akin to forced advection–diffusion problems. The long tail above wc, implying relatively frequent strong events, remains similar through the range of tropospheric temperature and SST spanning tropical large-scale conditions. A simple empirical closure illustrates time decay properties.},

	abstract = {Lateral mixing parameters in buoyancy-driven deep convection schemes are among the most sensitive and important unknowns in atmosphere models. Unfortunately, there is not a true optimum value for plume mixing rate, but rather a dilemma or tradeoff: Excessive dilution of updrafts leads to unstable stratification bias in the mean state, while inadequate dilution allows deep convection to occur too easily, causing poor space and time distributions and variability. In this too-small parameter space, compromises are made based on competing metrics of model performance. We attempt to escape this “entrainment dilemma” by making bulk plume parameters (chiefly entrainment rate) depend on a new prognostic variable (“organization,” org) meant to reflect the rectified effects of subgrid-scale structure in meteorological fields. We test an org scheme in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with a new unified shallow-deep convection scheme (UW-ens, a 2-plume version of the University of Washington scheme). Since buoyant ascent involves natural selection, subgrid structure makes convection systematically deeper and stronger than the pure unorganized case: plumes of average (or randomly sampled) air rising in the average environment. To reflect this, org is nonnegative, but we leave it dimensionless. A time scale characterizes its behavior (here ∼3 h for a 2o model). Currently its source is rain evaporation, but other sources can be added easily. We also let org be horizontally transported by advection, as a mass-weighted mean over the convecting layer. Linear coefficients link org to a plume ensemble, which it assists via: 1) plume base warmth above the mean temperature 2) plume radius enhancement (reduced mixing), and 3) increased probability of overlap in a multi-plume scheme, where interactions benefit later generations (this part has only been implemented in an offline toy column model). Since rain evaporation is a source for org, it functions as a time-lagged but positive feedback on deep convection development. This evades the entrainment dilemma, since fully developed org–enhanced convection is not overly dilute, avoiding stability bias, while the pioneering updrafts of new convection are suppressed by entrainment, encouraging more large-scale variability.},

The CA acts in two horizontal dimensions, with finer grid spacing than the NWP model. It is randomly seeded in regions where convective available potential energy (CAPE) exceeds a threshold value. Both deterministic and probabilistic rules, coupled to the large-scale wind, are explored to evolve the CA in time. Case studies indicate that the scheme has the potential to organize cells along convective squall lines and enhance advective effects. An ensemble of forecasts using the present CA scheme demonstrated an ensemble spread in the resolved wind field in regions where deep convection is large. Such a spread represents the uncertainty due to subgrid variability of deep convection and could be an interesting addition to an ensemble prediction system.},

In this study, we investigate the effects of wind shear at different vertical levels on the organization and properties of convective systems using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with spectral bin microphysics. Based on a control run for a MCS with weak wind shear (Ctrl), we find that increasing wind shear at the lower troposphere (L-shear) leads to a more organized quasi-line convective system. Strong wind shear in the middle troposphere (M-shear) tends to produce large vorticity and form a mesocyclone circulation and an isolated strong storm that leans toward supercellular structure. By increasing wind shear at the upper vertical levels only (U-shear), the organization of the convection is not changed much, but the convective intensity is weakened. Increasing wind shear in the middle troposphere for the selected case results in a significant drying, and the drying is more significant when conserving moisture advection at the lateral boundaries, contributing to the suppressed convective strength and precipitation relative to Ctrl. Precipitation in the L-shear and U-shear does not change much from Ctrl. Evident changes of cloud macrophysical and microphysical properties in the strong wind shear cases are mainly due to large changes in convective organization and water vapor. The insights obtained from this study help us better understand the major factors contributing to convective organization and precipitation.},

	abstract = {A minimal model of a moist equatorial atmosphere is presented in which the precipitation rate is assumed to depend on just the vertically averaged saturation deficit and the convective available potential energy. When wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) and cloud–radiation interactions are turned off, there are no growing modes. Gravity waves with wavenumbers smaller than a certain limit respond to a reduced static stability due to latent heat release, and therefore propagate more slowly than dry modes, while those with larger wavenumbers respond to the normal dry static stability. In addition, there exists a stationary mode that decays slowly with time. For realistic parameter values, the effect of reduced static stability on gravity waves is limited to wavelengths greater than the circumference of the earth. WISHE and cloud–radiation interactions both destabilize the stationary mode, but not the gravity waves.},

	abstract = {A linear perturbation analysis for the study of large-scale disturbances observed in the conditionally unstable atmosphere of low latitudes is attempted by use of a two-dimensional model in which latitudinal variations of wave properties are ignored. The effect of the conditionally unstable stratification is incorporated into the model with the assumption that the amount of released latent heat is proportional to the vertical velocity at the top of the surface boundary layer, as OOYAMA (1964) proposed in the research on tropical cyclones.Linear analysis shows that three kinds of unstable waves other than the tropical cyclone mode can exist in the conditionally unstable atmosphere in low latitudes. Two of them are unstable waves induced by the combined effect of heat and vertical wind shear of the zonal flow under the existence of surface friction. This type of unstable waves may be classified into two types with and without a steering level. The growth rate of the former increases with increasing vertical wind shear and the latitude, while that of the latter is maximum for moderate intensity of the shear and decreases with increasing latitude. The preferred horizontal scale of these waves is 2,000 to 4,000 km. Its structure is discussed in comparison with that of the easterly wave in the tropical troposphere.The preferred scale of the third wave is 2,000 to 12,000 km, depending upon the amount of heat released in the upper troposphere. This unstable wave can be obtained also in case of no vertical wind shear. In contrast to the other unstable waves this wave has large amplitudes in the lower stratosphere. Its phase lines have a large westward inclination with height in the stratosphere and an eastward inclination in the troposphere. This wave resembles the large-scale wave in the equatorial lower stratosphere discovered by YANAI and MARUYAMA (1966) when the amount of heat released in the upper troposphere is not so small.It is also shown that the vertical distribution of heat sources is of primary importance for the occurrence of these unsta ble waves.},

	abstract = {For the purpose of extending the theoretical interpretation of the large-scale equatorial waves discovered by Yanai and Maruyama (1966), a three dimensional linearized primitive equationmodel of unstable waves is constructed on an equatorial beta plane. It is assumed that the release of latent heat due to moist convection in the troposphere is disturbed in proportion to the horizontal convergence in the subcloud layer responding to large-scale equatorial waves. It is found that Mode HB in the theory of unstable low latitude disturbances by Yamasaki (1969) is characterized by complex equivalent depth which simulates many aspects of YanaiMaruyama waves. This mode is further classified into various meridional modes, following Matsuno (1966).When the heat in the upper troposphere exceeds a critical value, unstable waves of free internal mode come into existence. Their growth rate increases with increasing heat in the upper troposphere. With the exception of inertio-gravity waves and Kelvin waves, mixed Rossby-gravity waves are the most unstable. The period corresponding to the observed wavelength of 10, 000km coincides with the observed period of about 4 days. The e-folding time is of the order of 10 days which, however, decreases with increasing wavelength.The energy and momentum budgets are also examined in detail. It is shown that a nonlinear forcing by Rossby type waves results in easterly acceleration of the mean zonal wind in the lower stratosphere, while Kelvin waves accelerate a westerly flow.},

	abstract = {A simplified cumulus parameterization scheme, suitable for use in GCMs, is presented. This parameterization is based on a plume ensemble concept similar to that originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974). However, it employs three assumptions which significantly simplify the formulation and implementation of the scheme. It is assumed that an ensemble of convective‐scale updrafts with associated saturated downdrafts may exist when the atmosphere is locally conditionally unstable in the lower troposphere. However, the updraft ensemble is comprised only of those plumes which are sufficiently buoyant to penetrate through this unstable layer. It is assumed that all such plumes have the same upward mass flux at the base of the convective layer. The third assumption is that moist convection, which occurs only when there is convective available potential energy (CAPE) for reversible ascent of an undiluted parcel from the sub‐cloud layer, acts to remove CAPE at an exponential rate with a specified adjustment time scale. The performance of the scheme and its sensitivity to choices of disposable parameters is illustrated by presenting results from a series of idealized single‐column model tests. These tests demonstrate that the scheme permits establishment of a quasi‐equilibrium between large‐scale forcing and convective response. However, it is also shown that the strength of convective downdrafts is an important factor in determining the nature of the equilibrium state. Relatively strong down‐drafts give rise to an unsteady irregularly fluctuating state characterized by alternate periods of deep and shallow convection. The effect of using the scheme for GCM climate simulations is illustrated by presenting selected results of a multi‐year simulation carried out with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM using the new parameterization (the CONV simulation). Comparison of these results with those for a climate simulation made with the standard model (the CONTROL simulation, as documented by McFarlane et al., 1992) reveals the importance of other parameterized processes in determining the ultimate effect of introducing the new convective scheme. The radiative response to changes in the cloudiness regime is particularly important in this regard.},

Preliminary applications in a global numerical weather-prediction model and a mesoscale model are also discussed.

The application of the scheme to various scales is supported by the use of a convective available potential energy convective closure that assures a smooth interaction with the large-scale environment and efficiently suppresses conditional instability of the second kind-like spin-up processes on the grid-scale.

The CQE concept as originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974) is systematically reviewed from wider perspectives. Various interpretations and extensions of Arakawa and Schubert's CQE are considered both in terms of a thermodynamic analogy and as a dynamical balance. The thermodynamic interpretations can be more emphatically embraced as a homeostasis. The dynamic balance interpretations can be best understood by analogy with the slow manifold. Various criticisms of CQE can be avoided by taking the dynamic balance interpretation. Possible limits of CQE are also discussed, including the importance of triggering in many convective situations, as well as the possible self-organized criticality of tropical convection. However, the most intriguing aspect of the CQE concept is that in spite of many observational tests supporting and interpreting it in many different senses, it has never been established in a robust manner based on a systematic analysis of the cloud work function budget by observations as was originally defined.},

	abstract = {Determining the finite-amplitude preconditioned states in the hurricane embryo, which lead to tropical cyclogenesis, is a central issue in contemporary meteorology. In the embryo there is competition between different preconditioning mechanisms involving hydrodynamics and moist thermodynamics, which can lead to cyclogenesis. Here systematic asymptotic methods from applied mathematics are utilized to develop new simplified moist multi-scale models starting from the moist anelastic equations. Three interesting multi-scale models emerge in the analysis. The balanced mesoscale vortex (BMV) dynamics and the microscale balanced hot tower (BHT) dynamics involve simplified balanced equations without gravity waves for vertical vorticity amplification due to moist heat sources and incorporate nonlinear advective fluxes across scales. The BMV model is the central one for tropical cyclogenesis in the embryo. The moist mesoscale wave (MMW) dynamics involves simplified equations for mesoscale moisture fluctuations, as well as linear hydrostatic waves driven by heat sources from moisture and eddy flux divergences. A simplified cloud physics model for deep convection is introduced here and used to study moist axisymmetric plumes in the BHT model. A simple application in periodic geometry involving the effects of mesoscale vertical shear and moist microscale hot towers on vortex amplification is developed here to illustrate features of the coupled multi-scale models. These results illustrate the use of these models in isolating key mechanisms in the embryo in a simplified content.},

	abstract = {The accurate parameterization of moist convection presents a major challenge for the accurate prediction of weather and climate through numerical models. Superparameterization is a promising recent alternative strategy for including the effects of moist convection through explicit turbulent fluxes calculated from a cloud-resolving model. Basic scales for cloud-resolving modeling are the microscales on the order of 10 km in space on time scales on the order of 15 min, where vertical and horizontal motions are comparable and moist processes are strongly nonlinear (meso-gamma scale). In this paper, systematic multiscale asymptotic analysis is utilized to develop simplified microscale mesoscale dynamic (MMD) models for interaction between the microscales and spatiotemporal mesoscales on the order of 100 km and 2.5 h (meso-beta scale). The new MMD models lead to a systematic framework for superparameterization for numerical weather prediction (NWP) generalizing the traditional column modeling framework. The MMD formulation also provides a flexible systematic framework for devising new parameterization strategies for NWP intermediate between the two extremes of column modeling and detailed cloud-resolving modeling. It is also established here that these MMD models fit crudely into the recent systematic multiscale framework developed to explain the observed larger-scale statistical self-similarity of tropical convection, and therefore provide a systematic framework for superparameterization. Finally, it is shown that the new MMD models have the structure of a heterogeneous multiscale method so that many numerical techniques recently developed in the applied mathematics literature can be applied to this formulation.},

During COARE, sounding data were collected from 29 sites with Vaisala-manufactured systems and 13 sites with VIZ-manufactured systems. A recent publication has documented the characteristics of the humidity errors at the Vaisala sites and a procedure to correct them. This study extends that work by describing the nature of the VIZ humidity errors and their correction scheme. The corrections, which are largest in lower-tropospheric levels, generally increase the moisture in the Vaisala sondes and decrease it in the VIZ sondes. Use of the corrected humidity data gives a much different perspective on the characteristics of convection during COARE. For example, application of a simple cloud model shows that the peak in convective mass flux shifts from about 8°N with the uncorrected data to just south of the equator with corrected data, which agrees better with the diagnosed vertical motion and observed rainfall. Also, with uncorrected data the difference in mean convective available potential energy (CAPE) between Vaisala and VIZ sites is over 700 J kg−1; with the correction, both CAPEs are around ∼1300 J kg−1, which is consistent with a generally uniform warm pool SST field. These results suggest that the intensity and location of convection would differ significantly in model simulations with humidity-corrected data, and that the difficulties which the reanalysis products had in reproducing the observed rainfall during COARE may be due to the sonde humidity biases. The humidity-corrected data appear to have a beneficial impact on budget-derived estimates of rainfall and radiative heating rate, such that revised estimates show better agreement with those from independent sources.},

	abstract = {Many problems in complex dynamical systems involve metastable regimes despite nearly Gaussian statistics with underlying dynamics that is very different from the more familiar flows of molecular dynamics. There is significant theoretical and applied interest in developing systematic coarse-grained descriptions of the dynamics, as well as assessing their skill for both short- and long-range prediction. Clustering algorithms, combined with finite-state processes for the regime transitions, are a natural way to build such models objectively from data generated by either the true model or an imperfect model. The main theme of this paper is the development of new practical criteria to assess the predictability of regimes and the predictive skill of such coarse-grained approximations through empirical information theory in stationary and periodically-forced environments. These criteria are tested on instructive idealized stochastic models utilizing K -means clustering in conjunction with running-average smoothing of the training and initial data for forecasts. A perspective on these clustering algorithms is explored here with independent interest, where improvement in the information content of finite-state partitions of phase space is a natural outcome of low-pass filtering through running averages. In applications with time-periodic equilibrium statistics, recently developed finite-element, bounded-variation algorithms for nonstationary autoregressive models are shown to substantially improve predictive skill beyond standard autoregressive models.},

	abstract = {The primary goal of this paper is to validate the use of the anelastic approximation for fluids with a complex equation of state such as moist air or seawater. The anelastic approximation is based on a leading-order expansion of the equations of motion for a compressible fluid in terms of density. Its application to atmospheric flows has been based on a dry framework that treats phase transitions as an external energy source. However, cloudy air is more accurately described as a two-phase fluid in which condensed water and water vapor are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic equilibrium reduces to three the number of state variables necessary to describe the thermodynamic state of moist air, and leads to a discontinuity in the partial derivatives of the equation of state at the saturation point. A version of the anelastic approximation for a moist atmosphere is derived here by considering the atmospheric density as a small perturbation from a moist-adiabatic reference profile, and using moist entropy and total water content as prognostic variables, with buoyancy determined from the complete nonlinear equation of state. The key finding of this paper is that this implementation of the anelastic approximation conserves energy. The total energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic energy and the thermodynamic energy. The latter is found to be equal to the sum of the enthalpy and geopotential energy of the parcel. Furthermore, the state relationships between this thermodynamic energy, entropy, and other state variables are the same as those for moist air after replacing the total pressure with the reference state pressure. This guarantees that, as long as the pressure perturbation remains small, the thermodynamic behavior of a fluid under the anelastic approximation is fully consistent with both the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Two implications of this finding are also discussed. First, it is shown that the first and second laws of thermodynamics constrain the vertically integrated buoyancy flux. This is equivalent to deriving the total work performed in a compressible atmosphere from its entropy and energy budgets. Second, it is argued that an anelastic model can be built with temperature or enthalpy as a prognostic variable instead of entropy. The rate of change for this new state variable can be obtained from energy conservation, so that such a model explicitly obeys the first law of thermodynamics. The entropy in this model is equal to the entropy of the parcel evaluated at the reference pressure, and its evolution obeys the second law of thermodynamics.},

This has numerical advantages for modeling clouds, in which reversible phase changes of water occur frequently. The equations of motion are discretized using higher-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) discretization schemes with strong stability preserving time stepping. Numerical tests demonstrate that the WENO schemes yield simulations superior to centered schemes, even when the WENO schemes are used at coarser resolution.

It shows that convective updrafts transport a significant amount of momentum vertically. This transport is downgradient in the easterly wind regime, but upgradient during a westerly wind burst. The differences in convective momentum transport between easterly and westerly wind regimes are examined. The perturbation pressure gradient accounts for an important part of the apparent momentum source. In general it is opposite in sign to the product of cloud mass flux and the vertical wind shear, with smaller magnitude. Examination of the dynamic forcing to the pressure field demonstrates that the linear forcing representing the interaction between the convective updrafts and the large-scale wind shear is the dominant term, while the nonlinear forcing is of secondary importance. Thus, parameterization schemes taking into account the linear interaction between the convective updrafts and the large-scale wind shear can capture the essential features of the perturbation pressure field. The parameterization scheme for momentum transport by Zhang and Cho is evaluated using the model simulation data. The parameterized pressure gradient force using the scheme is in excellent agreement with the simulated one. The parameterized apparent momentum source is also in good agreement with the model simulation. Other parameterization methods for the pressure gradient are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Convective momentum transport (CMT) is the process of vertical transport of horizontal momentum by convection onto the environmental flow. The significance of CMT from mesoscale to synoptic- and planetary-scale organized cumulus convection has been established by various theoretical and observational studies. A new strategy mimicking the effect of unresolved mesoscale circulation based on the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation with a Gaussian profile to redistribute the heating due to parameterized cumulus convection at the subgrid scale is adopted here to construct a CMT parameterization for general circulation models (GCMs). Two main regimes of CMT are considered: an upscale squall-line regime and a downscale non-squall-line regime. An exponential probability distribution is used to select which of these two effects is active, conditional on the state of the large-scale shear. The shear itself is used as a measure of the persistence of mesoscale organized circulation due to the presence or not of tilted deep convective heating with lagged stratiform anvils. The CMT model is tested in the simple case of the multicloud model of Khouider and Majda, used here as a toy GCM. Numerical simulations are performed here for the simple case without rotation, in a parameter regime where the multicloud model exhibits packets of convectively coupled gravity waves moving in one direction, at 17 m s−1, and planetary-scale wave envelopes moving in the opposite direction, at 4–6 m s−1, reminiscent of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and the associated embedded synoptic-scale superclusters. The results herein show that the inclusion of CMT intensifies both the synoptic-scale convectively coupled waves and the manifestation of planetary-scale waves in the multicloud model. This provides evidence that the present CMT model captures the essence of the physical mechanism through which kinetic energy is transferred from the subgrid-scale mesoscale circulation to the large-scale/resolved motion. Sensitivity simulations showed that two key parameters for the CMT parameterization are the relative strength of the parameterized stratiform anvils and the dimensional threshold used in the exponential distribution for the cumulus friction and the upscale CMT forcing resulting from organized subgrid mesoscale circulation.},

They are canonical coherent structures in the tropics and middle latitudes reflecting upscale conversion of energy from moist buoyant sources to horizontal kinetic energy on larger scales. Here squall lines are introduced through high resolution numerical simulations which reveal a new self-similarity with respect to the shear amplitude. A new multi-scale model on mesoscales which allows for large vertical shears, appropriate for squall lines, is developed here through systematic multi-scale asymptotics. Mathematical and numerical formulations of the new multi-scale equations are utilized to illustrate both new mathematical and physical phenomena captured by these new models. In particular, non-hydrostatic Taylor-Goldstein equations govern the upscale transports of momentum and temperature from the order 10 km microscales to the order 100 km mesoscales; surprisingly, upright single mode convective heating without tilts can lead to significant upscale convective momentum transport from the microscales to the mesoscales due to the strong shear. The multi-scale models developed here should be especially useful for dynamic parameterizations of upscale transports as well as for new theory in three-dimensions with a transverse shear component, where contemporary theoretical understanding is meager.},

This study seeks to better quantify the organization and structure of Southern Hemisphere midlatitude clouds by combining measurements from active and passive satellite-based datasets. Geostationary and polar-orbiter satellite data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) are used to quantify large-scale, recurring modes of cloudiness, and active observations from CloudSat and Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) are used to examine vertical structure, radiative heating rates, and precipitation associated with these clouds. It is found that cloud systems are organized into eight distinct regimes and that ISCCP overestimates the midlevel cloudiness of these regimes. All regimes contain a relatively high occurrence of low cloud, with 79\% of all cloud layers observed having tops below 3 km, but multiple-layered clouds systems are present in approximately 34\% of observed cloud profiles. The spatial distribution of regimes varies according to season, with cloud systems being geometrically thicker, on average, during the austral winter. Those regimes found to be most closely associated with midlatitude cyclones produce precipitation the most frequently, although drizzle is extremely common in low-cloud regimes. The regimes associated with cyclones have the highest in-regime shortwave cloud radiative effect at the TOA, but the low-cloud regimes, by virtue of their high frequency of occurrence over the oceans, dominate both TOA and surface shortwave effects in this region as a whole.},

Nevertheless, efficient methods are needed to allow large ensemble simulations of sufficient size to provide meaningful quantifications of uncertainty in future predictions and past reanalyses through data assimilation and filtering. Here, a class of efficient stochastic superparameterization algorithms is introduced. In contrast to conventional superparameterization, the method here (i) does not require the simulation of nonlinear eddy dynamics on periodic embedded domains, (ii) includes a better representation of unresolved small-scale instabilities, and (iii) allows efficient representation of a much wider range of unresolved scales. The simplest algorithm implemented here radically improves efficiency by representing small-scale eddies at and below the limit of computational resolution by a suitable one-dimensional stochastic model of random-direction plane waves. In contrast to heterogeneous multiscale methods, the methods developed here do not require strong scale separation or conditional equilibration of local statistics. The simplest algorithm introduced here shows excellent performance on a difficult test suite of prototype problems for geophysical turbulence with waves, jets, and vortices, with a speedup of several orders of magnitude compared with direct simulation.},

However, because of the multiscale nature of CMT, quantifying and parameterizing its effects is often a challenge. Here a simple dynamic model with features of CMT is systematically derived and studied. The model includes interactions between a large-scale zonal mean flow and convectively coupled gravity waves, and convection is parameterized using a multicloud model. The moist convective wave–mean flow interactions shown here have several interesting features that distinguish them from other classical wave–mean flow settings. First an intraseasonal oscillation of the mean flow and convectively coupled waves (CCWs) is described. The mean flow oscillates due to both upscale and downscale CMT, and the CCWs weaken, change their propagation direction, and strengthen as the mean flow oscillates. The basic mechanisms of this oscillation are corroborated by linear stability theory with different mean flow background states. Another case is set up to imitate the westerly wind burst phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) in the simplified dynamic model. In this case, CMT first accelerates the zonal jet with the strongest westerly wind aloft, and then there is deceleration of the winds due to CMT; this occurs on an intraseasonal time scale and is in qualitative agreement with actual observations of the MJO. Also, in this case, a multiscale envelope of convection propagates westward with smaller-scale convection propagating eastward within the envelope. The simplified dynamic model is able to produce this variety of behavior even though it has only a single horizontal direction and no Coriolis effect.},

	abstract = {Summary. Rainfall data are often collected at coarser spatial scales than required for input into hydrology and agricultural models. We therefore describe a spatiotemporal model which allows multiple imputation of rainfall at fine spatial resolutions, with a realistic dependence structure in both space and time and with the total rainfall at the coarse scale consistent with that observed. The method involves the transformation of the fine scale rainfall to a thresholded Gaussian process which we model as a Gaussian Markov random field. Gibbs sampling is then used to generate realizations of rainfall efficiently at the fine scale. Results compare favourably with previous, less elegant methods.},

	abstract = {A model of the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is described that produces random spatial rainfall patterns with these characteristics: (1) The model is defined on a grid with each grid point representing the average rain rate over the surrounding grid box. (2) Rain occurs at any one grid point, on average, a specified percentage of the time and has a lognormal probability distribution. (3) Spatial correlation of the rainfall can be arbitrarily prescribed. (4) Time stepping is carried out so that large-scale features persist longer than small-scale features. Rain is generated in the model from the portion of a correlated Gaussian random field that exceeds a threshold. The portion of the field above the threshold is rescaled to have a lognormal probability distribution. Sample output of the model designed to mimic radar observations of rainfall during the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE), is shown. The model is intended for use in evaluating sampling strategies for satellite remote-sensing of rainfall and for development of algorithms for converting radiant intensity received by an instrument from its field of view into rainfall amount.},

	abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) (also called Karhunen–Loève expansion) has been recently used in turbulence to derive optimally fast converging bases of spatial functions, leading to efficient finite truncations. Whether a finite number of these modes can be used in numerical simulations to derive an “accurate” finite set of ordinary differential equations, over a certain range of bifurcation parameter values, still remains an open question. It is shown here that a necessary condition for achieving this goal is that the truncated system inherit the symmetry properties of the original infinite-dimensional system. In most cases, this leads to a systematic involvement of the symmetry group in deriving a new expansion basis called the symmetric POD basis. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation with periodic boundary conditions is used as a paradigm to illustrate this point of view. However, the conclusion is general and can be applied to other equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation, and others.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice reemergence is a phenomenon in which spring sea ice anomalies are positively correlated with fall anomalies, despite a loss of correlation over the intervening summer months. This work employs a novel data analysis algorithm for high-dimensional multivariate datasets, coupled nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA), to investigate the regional and temporal aspects of this reemergence phenomenon. Coupled NLSA modes of variability of sea ice concentration (SIC), sea surface temperature (SST), and sea level pressure (SLP) are studied in the Arctic sector of a comprehensive climate model and in observations. It is found that low-dimensional families of NLSA modes are able to efficiently reproduce the prominent lagged correlation features of the raw sea ice data. In both the model and observations, these families provide an SST–sea ice reemergence mechanism, in which melt season (spring) sea ice anomalies are imprinted as SST anomalies and stored over the summer months, allowing for sea ice anomalies of the same sign to reappear in the growth season (fall). The ice anomalies of each family exhibit clear phase relationships between the Barents–Kara Seas, the Labrador Sea, and the Bering Sea, three regions that compose the majority of Arctic sea ice variability. These regional phase relationships in sea ice have a natural explanation via the SLP patterns of each family, which closely resemble the Arctic Oscillation and the Arctic dipole anomaly. These SLP patterns, along with their associated geostrophic winds and surface air temperature advection, provide a large-scale teleconnection between different regions of sea ice variability. Moreover, the SLP patterns suggest another plausible ice reemergence mechanism, via their winter-to-winter regime persistence.},

Satellite infrared brightness temperature data in the tropical belt for the period 1983–2006 were decomposed into components symmetric and antisymmetric about the equator. Using a recent nonlinear objective method called nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis, modes of variability were extracted representing symmetric and antisymmetric features of MJO convection signals, along with a plethora of other modes of tropical convective variability spanning diurnal to interannual time scales. The space–time reconstruction of these modes during the 1992/93 Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) period is described in detail. In particular, the boreal winter MJO emerges as a single pair of modes in both symmetric and antisymmetric convection signals. Both signals originate in the Indian Ocean around 60°E. They coexist for all significant MJO events with a varying degree of relative importance, which is affected by ENSO. The symmetric signals tend to be suppressed when crossing the Maritime Continent, while the antisymmetric signals are not as inhibited. Their differences in peak phase and propagation speed suggest fundamental differences in the underlying mechanisms. The multiscale interactions between the diurnal, MJO, and ENSO modes of convection were studied. It was found that the symmetric component of MJO convection appears out of phase with the symmetric component of the diurnal cycle, while the antisymmetric component of MJO convection is in phase with the antisymmetric diurnal cycle. The former relationship likely breaks down during strong El Niño events, and both relationships likely break down during prolonged La Niña events.},

This issue is addressed in a geophysical context, by assessing the ability of these strategies for efficient dynamical modeling to reproduce the chaotic regime transitions in a simple atmosphere model. The atmosphere model is the well-known Charney– DeVore model, a six-dimensional truncation of the equations describing barotropic flow over topography in a β-plane channel geometry. This model is able to generate regime transitions for well-chosen parameter settings. The models based on PIPs are found to be superior to the EOF- and OPP-based models, in spite of some undesirable sensitivities inherent to the PIP method.},

We examine several preconditioners for the consistent L2Poisson operator arising in the PN− PN−2spectral element formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.

Toward numerical weather prediction efforts the semi-prognostic approach (i.e., a one time-step prediction of rainfall rates) provides a relevant test of cumulus parameterization methods. In this paper we compare five currently available cumulus parameterization schemes using the semi-prognostic approach. The calculated rainfall rates are compared with observed estimates provided in the recent publication of Hudlow and Patterson (1979). Among these the scheme proposed by Kuo (1974) provides the least root-mean-square error between the calculated and the observed estimates, slightly better than that of Arakawa and Schubert (1974), which was used by Lord (1978a). The simplicity of the approach holds promise for numerical weather prediction. Unlike some of the other schemes this method is not sensitive to and does not require computation of internal parameters such as profiles of cloud mass flux updrafts and downdrafts, detrainment of cloud matter and entrainment of environmental air. The present paper does not address the prognostic evolution and verification of the vertical distribution of temperature, humidity or momentum. These will be compared for the different methods in more detail separately.},

	abstract = {Aimed at reducing deficiencies in representing the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) in general circulation models (GCMs), a global model evaluation project on vertical structure and physical processes of the MJO was coordinated. In this paper, results from the climate simulation component of this project are reported. It is shown that the MJO remains a great challenge in these latest generation GCMs. The systematic eastward propagation of the MJO is only well simulated in about one fourth of the total participating models. The observed vertical westward tilt with altitude of the MJO is well simulated in good MJO models but not in the poor ones. Damped Kelvin wave responses to the east of convection in the lower troposphere could be responsible for the missing MJO preconditioning process in these poor MJO models. Several process-oriented diagnostics were conducted to discriminate key processes for realistic MJO simulations. While large-scale rainfall partition and low-level mean zonal winds over the Indo-Pacific in a model are not found to be closely associated with its MJO skill, two metrics, including the low-level relative humidity difference between high- and low-rain events and seasonal mean gross moist stability, exhibit statistically significant correlations with the MJO performance. It is further indicated that increased cloud-radiative feedback tends to be associated with reduced amplitude of intraseasonal variability, which is incompatible with the radiative instability theory previously proposed for the MJO. Results in this study confirm that inclusion of air-sea interaction can lead to significant improvement in simulating the MJO.},

	abstract = {The fine structure of super clusters was analyzed using the 3-hourly Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) Infrared (IR) data. A super cluster is defined as an ensemble of cloud clusters having different life stages with an observed horizontal scale of several thousand kilometers found near the equator during the active phase of intraseasonal variations (ISVs). Super clusters move eastward with a phase speed of about 10-15ms-1. GMS IR data reveal that the life time of each cloud cluster within a super cluster is about 1-2 days and its phase propagation is westward along the equator. Although each cloud cluster moves westward, a super cluster moves eastward due to the successive formation of a new cloud cluster east of the mature-stage cloud cluster. The above results suggest the existence of a hierarchy of convective activity in the tropical atmosphere.During the onset phase of the 1986/87 ENSO event in November 1986, an eastward moving super cluster was observed over the western Pacific to the dateline.},

There is a zonally symmetric component to the oscillation. It is manifest in changes in surface pressure and in the relative atmospheric angular momentum. The oscillation is an important factor in the timing of active and break phases of the Indian and Australian monsoons. It affects ocean waves, currents, and air-sea interaction.

	abstract = {Cloud fields adopt many different patterns that can have a profound effect on the amount of sunlight reflected back to space, with important implications for the Earth’s climate. These cloud patterns can be observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales of tens of kilometres. Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric aerosol particles—through their influence on precipitation formation—help to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective) or open (less reflective) cellular patterns. The physical mechanisms controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however, are still poorly understood, limiting our ability to simulate realistically the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different, weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down to the Earth’s surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell size and precipitation frequency.},

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of water vapor transport in the lower atmosphere that traverse long swaths of the Earth's surface as they bind together the atmospheric water cycle (Figure 1). The characteristic (indeed defining) dimensions of these ARs are (1) integrated water vapor (IWV) concentrations such that if all the vapor in the atmospheric column were condensed into liquid water, the result would be a layer 2 or more centimeters thick; (2) wind speeds of greater than 12.5 meters per second in the lowest 2 kilometers; and (3) a shape that is long and narrow, no more than 400–500 kilometers wide, and extending for thousands of kilometers, sometimes across entire ocean basins.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis of resting state blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is widely used for noninvasively studying brain functional networks. Recent findings have indicated, however, that even small (≤1 mm) amounts of head movement during scanning can disproportionately bias connectivity estimates, despite various preprocessing efforts. Further complications for interregional connectivity estimation from time domain signals include the unaccounted reduction in BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from high subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear echo-time dependence of signals—a characteristic property of BOLD signal changes. Here we show for 32 control subjects that this method provides a physically principled and nearly operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as motion from resting state data. We then describe a robust estimator of functional connectivity based on interregional correlation of BOLD-independent component coefficients. This estimator, called independent components regression, considerably simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity because degrees of freedom equals the number of independent coefficients. Compared with traditional connectivity estimation methods, the proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements in signal-to-noise ratio, functional connectivity analysis with improved specificity, and valid statistical inference with nominal control of type 1 error in contrasts of connectivity between groups with different levels of subject motion.},

Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95\% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis paper studies spatiotemporal modes of variability of sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Pacific sector in a comprehensive climate model and observations. These modes are obtained via nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA), a recently developed data analysis technique for high-dimensional nonlinear datasets. The existing NLSA algorithm is modified to allow for a scale-invariant coupled analysis of multiple variables in different physical units. The coupled NLSA modes are utilized to investigate North Pacific sea ice reemergence: a process in which sea ice anomalies originating in the melt season (spring) are positively correlated with anomalies in the growth season (fall) despite a loss of correlation in the intervening summer months. It is found that a low-dimensional family of NLSA modes is able to reproduce the lagged correlations observed in sea ice data from the North Pacific Ocean. This mode family exists in both model output and observations and is closely related to the North Pacific gyre oscillation (NPGO), a low-frequency pattern of North Pacific SST variability. Moreover, this mode family provides a mechanism for sea ice reemergence in which summer SST anomalies store the memory of spring sea ice anomalies, allowing for sea ice anomalies of the same sign to appear in the fall season. Lagged correlations in model output and observations are significantly strengthened by conditioning on the NPGO mode being active, in either positive or negative phase. Another family of NLSA modes, related to the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), is found to capture a winter-to-winter reemergence of SST anomalies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The momentum budget residual X = (X, Y) is estimated with objectively analyzed soundings taken during the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) intense observing period (IOP; November 1992–February 1993) to study the effects of convective momentum transport (CMT) over the western Pacific warm pool. The time series of X and Y exhibit multiscale temporal behavior, showing modulations by the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and other disturbances. The power spectra of X, Y, and ITBB (an index of convective activity) are remarkably similar, showing peaks near 10, 4–5, and 2 days, and at the diurnal period, suggesting a link between deep cumulus convection and the acceleration–deceleration of the large-scale horizontal motion, via CMT, which is being modulated by various atmospheric disturbances. The temporal behavior of X and Y can be described as fractals from 1/4 to ∼20 and from 1/4 to ∼16 days, respectively. Their fractal characteristics are reflected in the very large standard deviations around the small IOP means. From the analyses of the quantities uX/{\textbar}u{\textbar}, υY/{\textbar}υ{\textbar}, and v · X, the IOP-mean vertical distributions of the frictional force due to subgrid-scale eddies and the rate of kinetic energy transfer (E = −v · X) are determined. The frictional deceleration and downscale energy transfer take place in a deep tropospheric layer from the surface to 300 hPa. In addition, a concentration of large friction and energy transfer exists in a layer just below the tropopause, suggesting the contribution of momentum detrainment from the top of deep cumuli. The IOP-mean frictional deceleration and downscale energy transfer in the lower troposphere are ∼0.5–1.0 m s−1 day−1 and ∼1.0 × 10−4 m2 s−3, respectively. The product of eddy momentum flux with the large-scale vertical wind shear shows that the momentum transport is, on the average, downgradient; that is, kinetic energy is converted from the large-scale motion to convection and turbulence.},

Comparison between two sets of 20-yr (1979–98) integration using the NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) illustrates that the inclusion of CMT in the convection scheme systematically modifies the climate mean state over the equatorial region. The convective momentum tendencies slow down the equatorward flow at higher latitudes near the surface and weaken the equatorial convergence and convection. This reduces the convective heating and drying around the equator and produces an improved meridional distribution within the upward branch of the Hadley circulation. The major heating peak during the boreal winter is moved to south of the equator at about 10°S, which is closer to the heat budget residuals of the ECMWF reanalysis data. The responses of meridional wind to the reduced heating result in the secondary meridional circulation within the intertropical convergence zone.},

Owing to the lack of global observations, the quantification of the impact of this process on the tropospheric climate is difficult. Here an implementation of two convective momentum transport parameterizations, presented by Schneider and Lindzen and Gregory et al., in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3) is presented, and their effect on global climate is examined in detail. An analysis of the tropospheric zonal momentum budget reveals that convective momentum transport affects tropospheric climate mainly through changes to the Coriolis torque. These changes result in improvement of the representation of the Hadley circulation: in December–February, the upward branch of the circulation is weakened in the Northern Hemisphere and strengthened in the Southern Hemisphere, and the lower northerly branch is weakened. In June–August, similar improvements are noted. The inclusion of convective momentum transport in CAM3 reduces many of the model’s biases in the representation of surface winds, as well as in the representation of tropical convection. In an annual mean, the tropical easterly bias, subtropical westerly bias, and the bias in the 60°S jet are improved. Representation of convection is improved along the equatorial belt with decreased precipitation in the Indian Ocean and increased precipitation in the western Pacific. The improvements of the representation of tropospheric climate are greater with the implementation of the Schneider and Lindzen parameterization.},

	abstract = {Abstract Dynamical effects of organized cumulus convection on its environment with vertical wind shear are studied. Analyses of the wind field and momentum budget residual for mesoscale convective systems observed during SESAME and PRE-STORM reveal systematic differences in the vertical transport of horizontal momentum between mesoscale convective complex (MCC) and squall line cases. In the MCC, a distinct minimum in wind speed appears over the area of intense convection and the momentum budget residual acts to decelerate the environmental wind and to reduce the upper-level vertical shear. Therefore, the inferred vertical transport of momentum in the MCC is downgradient in the upper layer. On the other hand, in the squall line, there is no wind speed minimum and the upper-level vertical shear of the line-normall component of the environmental wind increases as convection develops. Thus, the vertical transport of momentum normal to the squall line is upgradient in the upper layer, although the transport of momentum parallel to the line is downgradient. The effects of cumulus convection on the environmental flow are through the subsidence of environmental air that compensates the cloud mass flux, the detrainment of momentum from clouds, and the convective-scale horizontal pressure gradient force acting on the environment. A cumulus momentum parameterization including the convective-scale pressure gradient force is formulated. The pressure gradient force is related to the vertical wind shear, cloud mass flux, and orientation of organized convection. The parameterization is capable of reproducing both the upgradient and downgradient transports of horizontal momentum, provided the mode of organization of cumulus convection is known.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is known that gravity waves in the troposphere, which are often excited by preexisting convection, can favor or suppress the formation of new convection. Here it is shown that in the presence of wind shear or barotropic wind, the gravity waves can create a more favorable environment on one side of preexisting convection than the other side. Both the nonlinear and linear analytic models developed here show that the greatest difference in favorability between the two sides is created by jet shears, and little or no difference in favorability is created by wind profiles with shear at low levels and no shear in the upper troposphere. A nonzero barotropic wind (or, equivalently, a propagating heat source) is shown to also affect the favorability on each side of the preexisting convection. It is shown that these main features are captured by linear theory, and advection by the background wind is the main physical mechanism at work. These processes should play an important role in the organization of wave trains of convective systems (i.e., convectively coupled waves); if one side of preexisting convection is repeatedly more favorable in a particular background wind shear, then this should determine the preferred propagation direction of convectively coupled waves in this wind shear. In addition, these processes are also relevant to individual convective systems: it is shown that a barotropic wind can lead to near-resonant forcing that amplifies the strength of upstream gravity waves, which are known to trigger new convective cells within a single convective system. The barotropic wind is also important in confining the upstream waves to the vicinity of the source, which can help ensure that any new convective cells triggered by the upstream waves are able to merge with the convective system. All of these effects are captured in a two-dimensional model that is further simplified by including only the first two vertical baroclinic modes. Numerical results are shown with a nonlinear model, and linear theory results are in good agreement with the nonlinear model for most cases.},

	abstract = {Stratified hydrostatic fluids have linear internal gravity waves with different phase speeds and vertical profiles. Here a simplified set of partial differential equations (PDE) is derived to represent the nonlinear dynamics of waves with different vertical profiles. The equations are derived by projecting the full nonlinear equations onto the vertical modes of two gravity waves, and the resulting equations are thus referred to here as the two-mode shallow water equations (2MSWE). A key aspect of the nonlinearities of the 2MSWE is that they allow for interactions between a background wind shear and propagating waves. This is important in the tropical atmosphere where horizontally propagating gravity waves interact together with wind shear and have source terms due to convection. It is shown here that the 2MSWE have nonlinear internal bore solutions, and the behavior of the nonlinear waves is investigated for different background wind shears. When a background shear is included, there is an asymmetry between the east- and westward propagating waves. This could be an important effect for the large-scale organization of tropical convection, since the convection is often not isotropic but organized on large scales by waves. An idealized illustration of this asymmetry is given for a background shear from the westerly wind burst phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation; the potential for organized convection is increased to the west of the existing convection by the propagating nonlinear gravity waves, which agrees qualitatively with actual observations. The ideas here should be useful for other physical applications as well. Moreover, the 2MSWE have several interesting mathematical properties: they are a system of nonconservative PDE with a conserved energy, they are conditionally hyperbolic, and they are neither genuinely nonlinear nor linearly degenerate over all of state space. Theory and numerics are developed to illustrate these features, and these features are important in designing the numerical scheme. A numerical method is designed with simplicity and minimal computational cost as the main design principles. Numerical tests demonstrate that no catastrophic effects are introduced when hyperbolicity is lost, and the scheme can represent propagating discontinuities without introducing spurious oscillations.},

	abstract = {A dynamical classification of organized convection is presented, and previously published and additional models are collated in a more general theory. the transport properties of each type are represented by flux laws, the motivation being to understand convective transports in the context of parametrization schemes for organized convection. Five distinct models, derived as analytic solutions to a general displacement equation obtained from conservation properties of the Boussinesq equations, are necessary to describe the dynamics. These models, designated propagating, steering-level, jump, cellular and classical, have very distinctive dynamical structures, and can be combined to represent more complex types of organized convection. The propagating and steering-level types export a significant amount of kinetic energy, momentum and entropy, while the jump and cellular types store a considerable amount of energy as work done on the environment by the pressure field. the classical type does not transport momentum, and is a representation of the classical thunderstorm in weakly sheared flow. Apart from the cellular model, although the entropy transports are broadly similar, the momentum and kinetic energy transports are very distinctive, with counter-gradient momentum transport the rule rather than the exception. Thus by effecting organized updraught/downdraught circulations, a completely different transport problem from small-scale cumulus and mixed-layer convection is posed, with fundamental inferences regarding parametrization. the dynamical necessity of a mesoscale response in the cellular and propagating types suggests that this scale may, in certain cases, need to be represented explicitly in convective parametrization schemes for large-scale models. These prototypes have been deliberately simplified for the sake of elucidating fundamental principles, and to give a dynamical basis for experimentation and generalization, through exploiting both cloud-scale and larger-scale numerical simulation models, as well as providing guidance in observational analyses, budget studies in particular.},

Such displays can also indicate aspects of the circulation within a certain type of mesoscale convective system—the squall line with trailing “stratiform” rain. Displays from a single Doppler radar collected in two squall-line storms observed during the Oklahoma-Kansas PRE-STORM project conducted in May and June 1985 reveal mesoscale-flow patterns in the stratiform rain region of the squall line, such as front-to-rear storm-relative flow at upper levels, a subsiding storm-relative rear inflow at middle and low levels, and low-level divergent flow associated with strong mesoscale subsidence. “Dual-Doppler” analysis further illustrates these mesoscale-flow features and, in addition, shows the structure of the convective region within the squall line and a mesoscale vortex in the “stratiform” region trailing the line. A refined conceptual model of this type of mesoscale convective system is presented based on previous studies and observations reported here. Recognition of “single-Doppler-radar” patterns of the type described in this paper, together with awareness of the conceptual model, should aid in the identification and interpretation of this type of mesoscale system at future NEXRAD sites. The dual-Doppler results presented here further indicate the utility of multiple-Doppler observations of mesoscale convective systems in the STORM program.},

Analysis of an experimental version of the superparameterized (SP) Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) demonstrates that propagating orogenic nocturnal convection in the central U.S. warm season is, however, representable in GCMs that use the embedded explicit convection model approach [i.e., multiscale modeling frameworks (MMFs)]. SP-CAM admits propagating organized convective systems in the lee of the Rockies during synoptic conditions similar to those that generate mesoscale convective systems in nature. The simulated convective systems exhibit spatial scales, phase speeds, and propagation speeds comparable to radar observations, and the genesis mechanism in the model agrees qualitatively with established conceptual models. Convective heating and condensate structures are examined on both resolved scales in SP-CAM, and coherently propagating cloud “metastructures” are shown to transcend individual cloud-resolving model arrays. In reconciling how this new mode of diurnal convective variability is admitted in SP-CAM despite the severe idealizations in the cloud-resolving model configuration, an updated discussion is presented of what physics may transcend the re-engineered scale interface in MMFs. The authors suggest that the improved diurnal propagation physics in SP-CAM are mediated by large-scale first-baroclinic gravity wave interactions with a prognostic organization life cycle, emphasizing the physical importance of preserving “memory” at the inner resolved scale.},

In this study, we look to the extratropics for possible causes of the double-ITCZ problem by performing a global energetic analysis with historical simulations from a suite of global climate models and comparing with satellite observations of the Earth’s energy budget. Our results show that models with more energy flux into the Southern Hemisphere atmosphere (at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface) tend to have a stronger double-ITCZ bias, consistent with recent theoretical studies that suggest that the ITCZ is drawn toward heating even outside the tropics. In particular, we find that cloud biases over the Southern Ocean explain most of the model-to-model differences in the amount of excessive precipitation in Southern Hemisphere tropics, and are suggested to be responsible for this aspect of the double-ITCZ problem in most global climate models.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a general method for the treatment of convective momentum transport (CMT) in large-scale dynamical solvers that use a cyclic, two-dimensional (2-D) cloud-resolving model (CRM) as a “superparameterization” of convective-system-scale processes. The approach is similar in concept to traditional parameterizations of CMT, but with the distinction that both the scalar transport and diagnostic pressure gradient force are calculated using information provided by the 2-D CRM. No assumptions are therefore made concerning the role of convection-induced pressure gradient forces in producing up or down-gradient CMT. The proposed method is evaluated using a new superparameterized version of the Weather Research and Forecast model (SP-WRF) that is described herein for the first time. Results show that the net effect of the formulation is to modestly reduce the overall strength of the large-scale circulation, via “cumulus friction.” This statement holds true for idealized simulations of two types of mesoscale convective systems, a squall line, and a tropical cyclone, in addition to real-world global simulations of seasonal (1 June to 31 August) climate. In the case of the latter, inclusion of the formulation is found to improve the depiction of key synoptic modes of tropical wave variability, in addition to some aspects of the simulated time-mean climate. The choice of CRM orientation is also found to importantly affect the simulated time-mean climate, apparently due to changes in the explicit representation of wide-spread shallow convective regions.},

This paper examines whether observations of the earth’s regional monsoons are consistent with the assumption of QE. It is shown here that in local summer climatologies based on reanalysis data, maxima of free-tropospheric temperature are, indeed, nearly collocated with maxima of subcloud equivalent potential temperature, θeb, in all monsoon regions except the North and South American monsoons. Free-tropospheric temperatures over North Africa also exhibit a strong remote influence from the South Asian monsoon. Consistent with idealized dynamical theories, peak precipitation falls slightly equatorward of the maxima in θeb and free-tropospheric temperature in regions where QE seems to hold. Vertical structures of temperature and wind reveal two types of monsoon circulations. One is the deep, moist baroclinic circulation clearly seen in the South Asian monsoon. The other is of mixed type, with the deep moist circulation superimposed on a shallow dry circulation closely associated with boundary layer temperature gradients. While the existence of a shallow dry circulation has been documented extensively in the North African monsoon, here it is shown to also exist in Australia and southern Africa during the local summer. Analogous to moist QE theories for the deep circulation, the shallow circulation can be viewed in a dry QE framework in which shallow ascent occurs just equatorward of the peak boundary layer potential temperature, θb, providing a unified system where the poleward extents of deep and shallow circulations are bounded by maxima in θeb and θb, respectively.},

Here, a combination of mathematical and physical reasoning is utilized to build simple stochastic models that capture the significant intermittent upscale transports of CMT on the large scales due to organized unresolved convection from squall lines. Properties of the stochastic model for CMT are developed below in a test column model environment for the large-scale variables. The effects of CMT from the stochastic model on a large-scale convectively coupled wave in an idealized setting are presented below as a nontrivial test problem. Here, the upscale transports from stochastic effects are significant and even generate a large-scale mean flow which can interact with the convectively coupled wave.},

By averaging the vertical mass flux at a constant value of the equivalent potential temperature, one can compute an isentropic mass transport that filters out reversible oscillatory motions such as gravity waves. This novel approach emphasizes the fact that the vertical energy and entropy transports by convection are due to the combination of ascending air parcels with high energy and entropy and subsiding air parcels with lower energy and entropy. Such conditional averaging can be extended to other dynamic and thermodynamic variables such as vertical velocity, temperature, or relative humidity to obtain a comprehensive description of convective motions. It is also shown how this approach can be used to determine the mean diabatic tendencies from the three-dimensional dynamic and thermodynamic fields.A two-stream approximation that partitions the isentropic circulation into a mean updraft and a mean downdraft is also introduced. This offers a straightforward way to identify the mean properties of rising and subsiding air parcels. The results from the two-stream approximation are compared with two other definitions of the cloud mass flux. It is argued that the isentropic analysis offers a robust definition of the convective mass transport that is not tainted by the need to arbitrarily distinguish between convection and its environment, and that separates the irreversible convective overturning from oscillations associated with gravity waves.},

	abstract = {Abstract The entropy budget of an atmosphere in radiative–convective equilibrium is analyzed here. The differential heating of the atmosphere, resulting from surface heat fluxes and tropospheric radiative cooling, corresponds to a net entropy sink. In statistical equilibrium, this entropy sink is balanced by the entropy production due to various irreversible processes such as frictional dissipation, diffusion of heat, diffusion of water vapor, and irreversible phase changes. Determining the relative contribution of each individual irreversible process to the entropy budget can provide important information on the behavior of convection. The entropy budget of numerical simulations with a cloud ensemble model is discussed. In these simulations, it is found that the dominant irreversible entropy source is associated with irreversible phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. In addition, a large fraction of the frictional dissipation results from falling precipitation, and turbulent dissipation accounts for only a small fraction of the entropy production. This behavior is directly related to the fact that the convective heat transport is mostly due to the latent heat transport. In such cases, moist convection acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine. The amount of work available to accelerate convective updrafts and downdrafts is much smaller than predicted by studies that assume that moist convection behaves mostly as a perfect heat engine.},

	abstract = {Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for solving nonlinear convection–diffusion equations in the sense that they are not tied to the specific eigenstructure of the problem, and hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box solvers for general conservation laws and related equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order Lax–Friedrichs scheme (P. D. Lax, 1954) is the forerunner for such central schemes. The central Nessyahu–Tadmor (NT) scheme (H. Nessyahu and E. Tadmor, 1990) offers higher resolution while retaining the simplicity of the Riemann-solver-free approach. The numerical viscosity present in these central schemes is of order O((Δx)2r/Δt). In the convective regime where Δt∼Δx, the improved resolution of the NT scheme and its generalizations is achieved by lowering the amount of numerical viscosity with increasing r. At the same time, this family of central schemes suffers from excessive numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced, e.g., due to the presence of degenerate diffusion terms.

In this paper we introduce a new family of central schemes which retain the simplicity of being independent of the eigenstructure of the problem, yet which enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity (of the corresponding order O(Δx)2r−1)). In particular, our new central schemes maintain their high-resolution independent of O(1/Δt), and letting Δt ↓ 0, they admit a particularly simple semi-discrete formulation. The main idea behind the construction of these central schemes is the use of more precise information of the local propagation speeds. Beyond these CFL related speeds, no characteristic information is required. As a second ingredient in their construction, these central schemes realize the (nonsmooth part of the) approximate solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the Riemann fans of varying size.

The semi-discrete central scheme is then extended to multidimensional problems, with or without degenerate diffusive terms. Fully discrete versions are obtained with Runge–Kutta solvers. We prove that a scalar version of our high-resolution central scheme is nonoscillatory in the sense of satisfying the total-variation diminishing property in the one-dimensional case and the maximum principle in two-space dimensions. We conclude with a series of numerical examples, considering convex and nonconvex problems with and without degenerate diffusion, and scalar and systems of equations in one- and two-space dimensions. Time evolution is carried out by the third- and fourth-order explicit embedded integration Runge–Kutta methods recently proposed by A. Medovikov (1998). These numerical studies demonstrate the remarkable resolution of our new family of central scheme.},

If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

	abstract = {Convective quasi-equilibrium (QE) has for several decades stood as a key postulate for parametrization of the impacts of moist convection at small scales upon the large-scale flow. Departures from QE have motivated stochastic convective parametrization, which in its early stages may be viewed as a sensitivity study. Introducing plausible stochastic terms to modify the existing convective parametrizations can have substantial impact, but, as for so many aspects of convective parametrization, the results are sensitive to details of the assumed processes. We present observational results aimed at helping to constrain convection schemes, with implications for each of conventional, stochastic or ‘superparametrization’ schemes. The original vision of QE due to Arakawa fares well as a leading approximation, but with a number of updates. Some, like the imperfect connection between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, and the importance of free-tropospheric moisture to buoyancy, are quantitatively important but lie within the framework of ensemble-average convection slaved to the large scale. Observations of critical phenomena associated with a continuous phase transition for precipitation as a function of water vapour and temperature suggest a more substantial revision. While the system's attraction to the critical point is predicted by QE, several fundamental properties of the transition, including high precipitation variance in the critical region, need to be added to the theory. Long-range correlations imply that this variance does not reduce quickly under spatial averaging; scaling associated with this spatial averaging has potential implications for superparametrization. Long tails of the distribution of water vapour create relatively frequent excursions above criticality with associated strong precipitation events.},

	abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes an analysis of large-scale [O(1000 km)] convectively coupled gravity waves simulated using a two-dimensional cloud-resolving model. The waves develop spontaneously under uniform radiative cooling and approximately zero-mean-flow conditions, with wavenumber 2 of the domain appearing most prominently and right-moving components dominating over left-moving components for random reasons. The analysis discretizes the model output in two ways. First, a vertical-mode transform projects profiles of winds, temperature, and heating onto the vertical modes of the model’s base-state atmosphere. Second, a cloud-partitioning algorithm sorts sufficiently cloudy grid columns into three categories: shallow convective, deep convective, and stratiform anvil. Results show that much of the tilted structures of the waves can be captured by just two main vertical spectral “bands,” each consisting of a pair of vertical modes. The “slow” modes have propagation speeds of 16 and 18 m s−1 (and roughly a full-wavelength vertical structure through the troposphere), while the “fast” modes have speeds of 35 and 45 m s−1 (and roughly a half-wavelength structure). Deep convection anomalies in the waves are more or less in phase with the low-level cold temperature anomalies of the slow modes and in quadrature with those of the fast modes. Owing to the characteristic life cycle of deep convective cloud systems, shallow convective heating peaks ∼2 h prior to maximum deep convective heating, while stratiform heating peaks ∼3 h after. The onset of deep convection in the waves is preceded by a gradual deepening of shallow convection lasting a period of many hours. Results of this study are in broad agreement with simple two-mode models of unstable large-scale wave growth, under the name “stratiform instability.” Differences here are that 1) the key dynamical modes have speeds in the range 16–18 m s−1, rather than 23–25 m s−1 (owing to a shallower depth of imposed radiative cooling), and 2) deep convective heating, as well as stratiform heating, is essential for the generation and maintenance of the slow modes.},

	abstract = {A cumulonimbus cloud may ascend and spawn its anvil cloud, precipitation, and downdrafts within an hour or so. This paper inquires why a similar progression of events (life cycle) is observed for tropical weather fluctuations with time scales of hours, days, and even weeks. Regressions using point data illustrate the characteristic unit of rain production: the mesoscale convective system (MCS), covering tens of kilometers and lasting several hours, with embedded convective rain cells. Meanwhile, averages over larger spatial areas indicate a self-similar progression from shallow to deep convection to stratiform anvils on many time scales.

Synthetic data exercises indicate that simple superpositions of fixed-structure MCS life cycles (the Building Block hypothesis) cannot explain why longer period life cycles are similar. Rather, it appears that an MCS may be a small analogue or prototype of larger scale waves. Multiscale structure is hypothesized to occur via a Stretched Building Block conceptual model, in which the widths (durations) of zones of shallow, deep, and stratiform anvil clouds in MCSs are modulated by larger scale waves.

Temperature (T) and humidity (q) data are examined and fed into an entraining plume model, in an attempt to elucidate their relative roles in these large-scale convection zone variations. T profile variations, with wavelengths shorter than troposphere depth, appear important for high-frequency ( ∼ 2–5-day period) convectively coupled waves, as density directly links convection (via buoyancy) and large-scale wave dynamics (via restoring force). Still, the associated q anomalies are several times greater than adiabatic, suggesting a strong amplification by shallow convective feedbacks. For lower frequency (intraseasonal) variability, q anomalies are considerably larger compared to T, and may be dominant.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper considers interactions between the moist atmospheric convection and the large-scale flow driven by the large-scale gradient of sea surface temperature. A two-dimensional computational framework is used with the horizontal domain size of 4000 km in which both the convective dynamics and the large-scale flow are resolved. Rotational effects are not considered. Simulations are performed using either a prescribed temperature tendency mimicking the effects of radiative processes or a fully interactive radiation transfer model. The simulations are performed for a period of 60 days with quasi-equilibrium conditions attained after about a month. The time-mean large-scale flow in the simulations features an ascending branch occupied by moist convection over a warm ocean and a cloud-free descending branch over a cold ocean. The time-mean flow for the prescribed radiation case features a complex vertical structure characterized by two somewhat decoupled circulations in the lower and upper troposphere. This is in stark contrast with the predominant first-baroclinic-mode structure typical of the observed large-scale tropical circulations, which is characterized by a single cell. An idealized dry model featuring prescribed convective heat source suggests that the complex vertical structure is directly related to the deviation of the model temperature profile from the climatology. Quasi-two-day oscillations are a major transient feature of the simulations. The oscillations are associated with radiation of gravity waves from the convective branch into the descending branch. Inclusion of the interactive radiation results in a significant modification of the large-scale flow and has a dramatic impact on the strength and horizontal extent of convection. Water vapor and cloud condensate strongly interact with radiative processes to induce these paramount effects on the tropical large-scale circulations.},

The model is unique in its representation of environmental entrainment and updraft detrainment rates. In particular, the two-way exchange of mass between clouds and their environment is modulated at each vertical level by a buoyancy sorting mechanism at the interface of clear and cloudy air. The new entrainment/detrainment scheme allows vertical profiles of both updraft moisture detrainment and updraft vertical mass flux to vary in a physically realistic way as a function of the cloud-scale environment. These performance characteristics allow the parameterized vertical distribution of convective heating and drying to be much more responsive to environmental conditions than is possible with a traditional one-dimensional entraining plume model. The sensitivities of the new model to variations in environmental convective available potential energy and vertical moisture distribution in idealized convective environments are demonstrated and its sensitivities to several key control parameters are examined. Finally, the performance of the new model in the Fritsch–Chappell CPS is evaluated. Parameterized heating and drying profiles are elucidated as they relate to the convective environment and to the type of cloud model used in the CPS.},

The two modes exchange energy through highly nonlinear interaction terms. We consider a periodic channel domain, oriented zonally and centered around the equator and adopt a fractional stepping–splitting strategy, for the governing system of equations, dividing it into three natural pieces which independently preserve energy. We obtain a scheme which preserves geostrophic steady states with minimal ad hoc dissipation by using state of the art numerical methods for each piece: The f-wave algorithm for conservation laws with varying flux functions and source terms of Bale et al. (2002) for the advected baroclinic waves and the Riemann solver-free non-oscillatory central scheme of Levy and Tadmor (1997) for the barotropic-dispersive waves. Unlike the traditional use of a time splitting procedure for conservation laws with source terms (here, the Coriolis forces), the class of balanced schemes to which the f-wave algorithm belongs are able to preserve exactly, to the machine precision, hydrostatic (geostrophic) numerical-steady states. The interaction terms are gathered into a single second order accurate predictor-corrector scheme to minimize energy leakage. Validation tests utilizing known exact solutions consisting of baroclinic Kelvin, Yanai, and equatorial Rossby waves and barotropic Rossby wave packets are given.},

In this study, using the data from constrained variational analysis by the Atmospheric System Research program for single-column models (SCM), the performance of the commonly used convective trigger functions in GCMs is evaluated based on the equitable threat score (ETS) value, a widely used forecast verification metric. From the ETS score, three consistently better-performing trigger functions were identified. They are based on the dilute and undilute convective available potential energy (CAPE) generation rate from large-scale forcing in the free troposphere (hereafter dCAPE) and parcel buoyancy at the lifting condensation level (Bechtold scheme). The key variables used to define these trigger functions are examined in detail. It is found that the dilute dCAPE trigger function performs the best consistently in both the tropical and midlatitude convective environment. Analysis of the composite fields of key variables of the trigger functions, based on the correct prediction, overprediction and underprediction of convection, and correct prediction of no-convection cases for convective onset, brings to light some critical factors responsible for the performance of the trigger functions. The lower-tropospheric advective forcing in dilute dCAPE trigger and vertical velocity in Bechtold trigger are identified to be the most importance ones. Suggestions are offered for further improvements.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe relationship between convective penetration depth and tropospheric humidity is central to recent theories of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). It has been suggested that general circulation models (GCMs) poorly simulate the MJO because they fail to gradually moisten the troposphere by shallow convection and simulate a slow transition to deep convection. CloudSat and Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data are analyzed to document the variability of convection depth and its relation to water vapor during the MJO transition from shallow to deep convection and to constrain GCM cumulus parameterizations. Composites of cloud occurrence for 10 MJO events show the following anticipated MJO cloud structure: shallow and congestus clouds in advance of the peak, deep clouds near the peak, and upper-level anvils after the peak. Cirrus clouds are also frequent in advance of the peak. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) column water vapor (CWV) increases by {\textasciitilde}5 mm during the shallow–deep transition phase, consistent with the idea of moisture preconditioning. Echo-top height of clouds rooted in the boundary layer increases sharply with CWV, with large variability in depth when CWV is between {\textasciitilde}46 and 68 mm. International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project cloud classifications reproduce these climatological relationships but correctly identify congestus-dominated scenes only about half the time. A version of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2 (GISS-E2) GCM with strengthened entrainment and rain evaporation that produces MJO-like variability also reproduces the shallow–deep convection transition, including the large variability of cloud-top height at intermediate CWV values. The variability is due to small grid-scale relative humidity and lapse rate anomalies for similar values of CWV.},

A linearized, two-dimensional, non-rotating model of the tropical atmosphere is presented here which incorporates all of these factors into its convective closure in a simplified fashion. Two types of large-scale unstable modes develop in this model, a slowly propagating ‘moisture mode’ which is driven primarily by saturation fraction anomalies, and a convectively coupled ‘gravity mode’ which is governed by anomalies in convective inhibition caused by buoyancy variations just above the top of the planetary boundary layer. The gravity mode maps onto the equatorial Kelvin wave in the earth's atmosphere and the predicted propagation speed for this mode is close to the observed phase speed of convectively coupled equatorial Kelvin waves. For reasonable parameter values the growth rate peaks at zonal wavenumbers at which Kelvin waves exhibit the greatest spectral energy. The computed vertical structure matches that of observed Kelvin waves, but is produced by a simple sinusoidal vertical heating profile with half-wavelength equal to the depth of the troposphere.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis of convective quasi-equilibrium states that moist convection reacts almost instantly to drive the atmospheric temperature profile throughout the troposphere to one of a special subset of possible profiles. In a simple case this might consist of a moist adiabat with the saturated moist entropy of the adiabat equaling the moist entropy of the boundary layer. In more complex cases the target temperature profile might depend on the moisture profile as well as boundary layer conditions. We present evidence from analytical and numerical calculations which challenge the validity of this hypothesis. These calculations involve both a simple, physically based parameterization of the effects of convection on its environment and a complex cloud-resolving model. In both cases we show that imposed temperature perturbations in the lower troposphere are rapidly eliminated, while those in the upper troposphere are not. The rapid temperature relaxation in the lower troposphere is due to the near-instantaneous change in the precipitation rate and latent heat release provoked by the temperature anomaly. Water vapor is so limited in the upper troposphere that this process cannot act there.},

Theoretical arguments and the results of cloud-resolving models are discussed in order to motivate the form of the scheme. In the deterministic limit, it tends to a spectrum of entraining/detraining plumes and is similar to other current parameterizations. The stochastic variability describes the local fluctuations about a large-scale equilibrium state. Plumes are drawn at random from a probability distribution function (PDF) that defines the chance of finding a plume of given cloud-base mass flux within each model grid box. The normalization of the PDF is given by the ensemble-mean mass flux, and this is computed with a CAPE closure method. The characteristics of each plume produced are determined using an adaptation of the plume model from the Kain–Fritsch parameterization. Initial tests in the single-column version of the Unified Model verify that the scheme is effective in producing the desired distributions of convective variability without adversely affecting the mean state.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new approach is proposed for stochastic parameterization of subgrid-scale processes in models of atmospheric or oceanic circulation. The new approach relies on two key ingredients: first, the unresolved processes are represented by a Markov chain whose properties depend on the state of the resolved model variables; second, the properties of this conditional Markov chain are inferred from data. The parameterization approach is tested by implementing it in the framework of the Lorenz ’96 model. Performance of the parameterization scheme is assessed by inspecting probability distributions, correlation functions, and wave properties, and by carrying out ensemble forecasts. For the Lorenz ’96 model, the parameterization algorithm is shown to give good results with a Markov chain with a few states only and to outperform several other parameterization schemes.},

One and two baroclinic mode models are tested in both the context of a one-column model and the context of a full spatial dependency that permits waves to propagate and interact with the diurnal cycle. It is found that a one baroclinic mode model is capable of reproducing a realistic diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation both over land and over the ocean provided an adequate switch function is used to mimic the congestus preconditioning mechanism that operates in the multicloud model of Khouider and Majda. However, a full two baroclinic mode multicloud model is needed to capture the interaction of convectively coupled tropical waves with the diurnal cycle. In a more conventional mass flux parameterization framework, both one and two baroclinic mode models fail to capture the diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation.},

	abstract = {The diurnal cycle of tropical convection is investigated with global cloud imagery constructed from 11μm radiance measurements taken aboard six satellites. Four harmonics of the diurnal cycle are resolved in the cloud imagery with about 50 km horizontal resolution. To isolate deep convective activity from other processes which cause diurnal fluctuations in longwave radiance, an index of deep convective activity is constructed by thresholding to brightness temperatures less than 230 K. Significant diurnal amplitude of deep convection is found only over tropical landmasses. Over the tropical oceans the diurnal cycle is weak and is barely discernible from the background red spectrum of convective variance. Nonetheless, oceanic convection exhibits a systematic diurnal fluctuation with maximum intensity in the early morning. Nocturnal subsidence along the cloud-free equator is postulated to play a role in forcing diurnal variation in the intertropical convergence zones. Other mechanisms are also implied to contribute as a similar early morning maximum in deep convection is seen even where no adjoining cloud-free regions occur. The diurnal cycle of deep convection is found to be organized on planetary scales predominantly in nonmigrating modes (i.e., modes with phase speeds not equal to that of the Sun). The nonmigrating modes are postulated to be produced by the nonuniform distribution of convective centers. The nonmigrating, zonally symmetric component is found to be especially large. While the role of this mode in forcing diurnal variations of the tropospheric circulation (e.g., the Hadley cell) is questionable, its role in modulating the ionospheric electric potential is well established. Discrepancies with the traditional notion that cloud-to-ground lightning is the dominant mechanism by which the Earth is negatively charged are discussed. In particular, the probable role of nonlightning-producing clouds (e.g., the stratiform portion of convective complexes) in diurnally modulating the negative charge on Earth is discussed.},

	abstract = {AbstractCumulus parameterizations in weather and climate models frequently apply mass-flux schemes in their description of tropical convection. Mass flux constitutes the product of the fractional area covered by convection in a model grid box and the vertical velocity in cumulus clouds. However, vertical velocities are difficult to observe on GCM scales, making the evaluation of mass-flux schemes difficult. Here, the authors combine high-temporal-resolution observations of in-cloud vertical velocities derived from a pair of wind profilers over two wet seasons at Darwin with physical properties of precipitating clouds [cloud-top heights (CTH), convective–stratiform classification] derived from the Darwin C-band polarimetric radar to provide estimates of cumulus mass flux and its constituents. The length of this dataset allows for investigations of the contributions from different cumulus cloud types—namely, congestus, deep, and overshooting convection—to the overall mass flux and of the influence of large-scale conditions on mass flux. The authors found that mass flux was dominated by updrafts and, in particular, the updraft area fraction, with updraft vertical velocity playing a secondary role. The updraft vertical velocities peaked above 10 km where both the updraft area fractions and air densities were small, resulting in a marginal effect on mass-flux values. Downdraft area fractions are much smaller and velocities are much weaker than those in updrafts. The area fraction responded strongly to changes in midlevel large-scale vertical motion and convective inhibition (CIN). In contrast, changes in the lower-tropospheric relative humidity and convective available potential energy (CAPE) strongly modulate in-cloud vertical velocities but have moderate impacts on area fractions. Although average mass flux is found to increase with increasing CTH, it is the environmental conditions that seem to dictate the magnitude of mass flux produced by convection through a combination of effects on area fraction and velocity.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the effect of a simple convection scheme on the zonally averaged tropical general circulation is examined within an idealized moist GCM to obtain broad classifications of the influence of convection on the Tropics. This is accomplished with a simplified convection scheme in the style of Betts and Miller. The scheme is utilized in a moist GCM with simplified physical parameterizations (gray radiation, with zonally symmetric, slab mixed layer ocean boundary conditions). Comparisons are made with simulations without a convection scheme [i.e., with large-scale condensation (LSC) only], with the moist convective adjustment (MCA) parameterization, and with various formulations and parameter sets with a simplified Betts–Miller (SBM) scheme. With the control run using the SBM scheme, the Tropics become quieter and less dependent on horizontal resolution as compared with the LSC or MCA simulations. The Hadley circulation mass transport is significantly reduced with the SBM scheme, as is the ITCZ precipitation. An important factor determining this behavior is the parameterization of shallow convection: without shallow convection, the convection scheme is largely ineffective at preventing convection from occurring at the grid scale. The sensitivities to convection scheme parameters are also examined. The simulations are remarkably insensitive to the convective relaxation time, and only mildly sensitive to the relative humidity of the reference profile, provided significant large-scale condensation is not allowed to occur. The changes in the zonally averaged tropical circulation that occur in all the simulations are understood based on the convective criteria of the schemes and the gross moist stability of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract CISK (Conditional Instability of the Second Kind) is examined for internal waves where low-level convergence is due to the inviscid wave fields rather than to Ekman pumping. It is found that CISK-induced waves must give rise to mean cumulus activity (since there are no negative clouds), and it is suggested that this mean activity plays an important role in the finite-amplitude equilibration of the system. The most unstable CISK waves will be associated with very short vertical wavelengths [O(3 km)] in order to maximize (in some crude sense) subcloud convergence. Thus, the vertical scale is largely determined by the height of cloud base. The vertical scale, in turn, determines the dispersive relations between horizontal and temporal scales. It is found that there exists a wave-CISK mode which is independent of longitude, and hence independent of the mean zonal flow. Because of this independence, the period of this oscillation should form a prominent line in tropical spectra. This period turns out to be about 4.8 days which is indeed a prominent feature of tropical spectra. It is shown, due to longitudinal inhomogeneities in the tropics (such as land-sea), that the above oscillation must be accompanied by traveling disturbances whose period with respect to the ground will also be 4.8 days and whose longitudinal scales will typically be from 1000–3000 km depending on the mean zonal flow. It is further shown that the existence of the above oscillatory system has two additional implications: The above system is, itself, unstable with respect to gravity waves with horizontal scales on the order of 100–200 km. Such waves may be associated with cloud clusters.The above system leads to maximum low-level convergence (and hence, a tendency toward mean cumulus activity) in regions centered about ±6°–7° latitude, thus providing a possible explanation for the position of the ITCZ.},

	abstract = {Abstract A case study of a convectively coupled Kelvin wave in the eastern Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is presented, as observed during the 1997 Pan American Climate Studies (PACS) Tropical Eastern Pacific Process Study (TEPPS). The large-scale convective envelope associated with this disturbance, with a zonal scale of approximately 1000–2000 km, propagates eastward at 15 m s−1 along the mean convective axis of the ITCZ. This envelope consists of many smaller-scale, westward-moving convective elements, with zonal scales on the order of 100–500 km. As the convectively coupled Kelvin wave disturbance propagates eastward, it exerts a strong control on local convection. Radar and vertical profiler data collected aboard the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown during the wave passage show that convection deepens rapidly as the Kelvin wave approaches from the west, progressing from isolated, shallow cumuli to organized deep convective features within just 12 h. Initially, rainfall in the vicinity of the ship consists of a significant deep convective fraction, but as the large-scale envelope departs to the east, stratiform precipitation becomes dominant. Radiosonde data collected during the Kelvin wave passage reveal dynamical perturbations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere that are consistent with linear equatorial Kelvin wave theory. The TEPPS radiosonde data also compare remarkably well with the vertical structure of a typical eastern Pacific Kelvin wave disturbance in the ECMWF reanalysis dataset, based on a 15-yr linear regression analysis. When this analysis is expanded to include all global grid points, it is shown that Kelvin waves in the eastern Pacific ITCZ have a dynamical structure that is nearly symmetric with respect to the equator, as would be expected based on linear Kelvin wave theory. However, the convective signal associated with these symmetric dynamical perturbations is itself primarily asymmetric with respect to the equator. The deepest convection is located significantly to the north of the equator, in the region of warmest sea surface temperatures. These observations present a somewhat different perspective on the dynamics of convectively coupled Kelvin waves, in that the symmetric dynamical fields and asymmetric convection interact to sustain the simultaneous eastward propagation of both fields.},

	abstract = {Abstract Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific occur during the development of most El Niño events and are believed to be a major factor in ENSO’s dynamics. Because of their short time scale, WWBs are normally considered part of a stochastic forcing of ENSO, completely external to the interannual ENSO variability. Recent observational studies, however, suggest that the occurrence and characteristics of WWBs may depend to some extent on the state of ENSO components, implying that WWBs, which force ENSO, are modulated by ENSO itself. Satellite and in situ observations are used here to show that WWBs are significantly more likely to occur when the warm pool is extended eastward. Based on these observations, WWBs are added to an intermediate complexity coupled ocean–atmosphere ENSO model. The representation of WWBs is idealized such that their occurrence is modulated by the warm pool extent. The resulting model run is compared with a run in which the WWBs are stochastically applied. The modulation of WWBs by ENSO results in an enhancement of the slow frequency component of the WWBs. This causes the amplitude of ENSO events forced by modulated WWBs to be twice as large as the amplitude of ENSO events forced by stochastic WWBs with the same amplitude and average frequency. Based on this result, it is suggested that the modulation of WWBs by the equatorial Pacific SST is a critical element of ENSO’s dynamics, and that WWBs should not be regarded as purely stochastic forcing. In the paradigm proposed here, WWBs are still an important aspect of ENSO’s dynamics, but they are treated as being partially stochastic and partially affected by the large-scale ENSO dynamics, rather than being completely external to ENSO. It is further shown that WWB modulation by the large-scale equatorial SST field is roughly equivalent to an increase in the ocean–atmosphere coupling strength, making the coupled equatorial Pacific effectively self-sustained.},

The authors construct a composite for each type of event, show that a simple propagating Gaussian model satisfactorily describes the evolution of zonal wind anomaly for each type of event, and determine the scales of each composite event by fitting the model to each composite. The authors discuss the WWEs that occurred during the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) intensive observing period (IOP) and show the extent to which these composite events are able to reproduce the major westerly wind features of the IOP. The frequency of occurrence of each type of WWE for each year of this record and by calendar month are described; the authors find several types of events are negatively correlated with the annual mean troup Southern Oscillation index (SOI), and that the stronger WWEs often have a statistically significant seasonality. Several instances of widespread westerly wind anomaly are identified and described, but these “mega”-WWEs have few features in common. Although the authors’ composites underestimate the peak amplitude of many WWEs and cannot always accurately represent the time evolution of each WWE, the authors believe that they offer a useful framework for representing the sort of westerly wind variability that occurs in the western and central tropical Pacific and can provide a basis for further study of the importance of such winds in the climatological and interannual variability of this part of the World Ocean.},

This work is a step toward the construction of a balanced dynamical theory for the tropical circulation that is based on this constraint, and in which the diabatic processes are explicit and interactive. The authors first derive the basic fluid-dynamical scaling under the weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation in a shallow water system with a fixed mass source representing an externally imposed heating. This derivation follows an earlier similar one by Held and Hoskins, but extends the analysis to the nonlinear case (though on an f plane), examines the resulting system in more detail, and presents a solution for an axisymmetric “top-hat” forcing. The system is truly balanced, having no gravity waves, but is different from other balance models in that the heating is included a priori in the scaling. The WTG scaling is then applied to a linear moist model in which the convective heating is controlled by a moisture variable that is advected by the flow. This moist model is derived from the Quasi-equilibrium Tropical Circulation Model (QTCM) equations of Neelin and Zeng but can be viewed as somewhat more general. A number of additional approximations are made in order to consider balanced dynamical modes, apparently not studied previously, which owe their existence to interactions of the moisture and flow fields. A particularly interesting mode arises on an f plane with a constant background moisture gradient. In the limit of low frequency and zero meridional wavenumber this mode has a dispersion relation mathematically identical to that of a barotropic Rossby wave, though the phase speed is eastward (for moisture decreasing poleward in the background state) and the propagation mechanism is quite different. This mode also has significant positive growth rate for low wavenumbers. The addition of the β effect complicates matters. For typical parameters, when β is included the direction of phase propagation is ambiguous, and the growth rate reduced, as the effects of the background gradients in moisture and planetary vorticity appear to cancel to a large degree. Possible relevance to intraseasonal variability and easterly wave dynamics is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study evaluates the tropical intraseasonal variability, especially the fidelity of Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) simulations, in 14 coupled general circulation models (GCMs) participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Eight years of daily precipitation from each model’s twentieth-century climate simulation are analyzed and compared with daily satellite-retrieved precipitation. Space–time spectral analysis is used to obtain the variance and phase speed of dominant convectively coupled equatorial waves, including the MJO, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby (ER), mixed Rossby–gravity (MRG), and eastward inertio–gravity (EIG) and westward inertio–gravity (WIG) waves. The variance and propagation of the MJO, defined as the eastward wavenumbers 1–6, 30–70-day mode, are examined in detail. The results show that current state-of-the-art GCMs still have significant problems and display a wide range of skill in simulating the tropical intraseasonal variability. The total intraseasonal (2–128 day) variance of precipitation is too weak in most of the models. About half of the models have signals of convectively coupled equatorial waves, with Kelvin and MRG–EIG waves especially prominent. However, the variances are generally too weak for all wave modes except the EIG wave, and the phase speeds are generally too fast, being scaled to excessively deep equivalent depths. An interesting result is that this scaling is consistent within a given model across modes, in that both the symmetric and antisymmetric modes scale similarly to a certain equivalent depth. Excessively deep equivalent depths suggest that these models may not have a large enough reduction in their “effective static stability” by diabatic heating. The MJO variance approaches the observed value in only 2 of the 14 models, but is less than half of the observed value in the other 12 models. The ratio between the eastward MJO variance and the variance of its westward counterpart is too small in most of the models, which is consistent with the lack of highly coherent eastward propagation of the MJO in many models. Moreover, the MJO variance in 13 of the 14 models does not come from a pronounced spectral peak, but usually comes from part of an overreddened spectrum, which in turn is associated with too strong persistence of equatorial precipitation. The two models that arguably do best at simulating the MJO are the only ones having convective closures/triggers linked in some way to moisture convergence.},

	abstract = {Abstract A toy model of large-scale deep convection variations is constructed around a radiative–convective equilibrium climate, with an observed mean sounding as its thermodynamic basic state. Vertical structure is truncated at two modes, excited by convective (one-signed) and stratiform (two-signed) heating processes in tropical deep convection. Separate treatments of deep and shallow convection are justified by observations that deep convection is more variable. Deep convection intensity is assumed to be modulated by convective available potential energy (CAPE), while occurrence frequency is modulated by the ratio of convective inhibition (CIN) to “triggering energy” K, a scalar representing the intensity of subgrid-scale fluctuations. Deep convective downdrafts cool and dry the boundary layer but also increase K. Variations of K make the relationship between convection and thermodynamic variables (CAPE, CIN, θe) nonunique and amplify the deep convective response to temperature waves of small (∼1°C) amplitude. For a parameter set in which CAPE variations control convection, moist convective damping destroys all variability. When CIN/K variations have dominant importance (the “inhibition-controlled” regime), a mechanism termed “stratiform instability” generates large-scale waves. This mechanism involves lower-tropospheric cooling by stratiform precipitation, which preferentially occurs where the already cool lower troposphere favors deep convection, via smaller CIN. Stratiform instability has two subregimes, based on the relative importance of the two opposite effects of downdrafts: When boundary layer θe reduction (a local negative feedback) is stronger, small-scale waves with frequency based on the boundary layer recovery time are preferred. When the K-generation effect (positive feedback) is stronger, very large scales (low wavenumbers of the domain) develop. A mixture of these scales occurs for parameter choices based on observations. Model waves resemble observed waves, with a phase speed ∼20 m s−1 (near the dry wave speed of the second internal mode), and a “cold boomerang” vertical temperature structure. Although K exhibits “quasi-equilibrium” with other convection variables (correlations {\textgreater} 0.99), replacing the prognostic K equation with diagnostic equations based on these relationships can put the model into wildly different regimes, if small time lags indicative of causality are distorted. The response of model convection to climatological spatial anomalies of θe (proxy for SST) and K (proxy for orographic and coastal triggering) is considered. Higher SST tends broadly to favor convection under either CAPE-controlled or inhibition-controlled regimes, but there are dynamical embellishments in the inhibition-controlled regime. The Kelvin wave seems to be the preferred structure when the model is run on a uniform equatorial β plane.},

	abstract = {AbstractPrevious studies have demonstrated a link between gross moist stability (GMS) and intraseasonal variability in theoretical and reduced-complexity models. In such simplified models, MJO-like moisture modes—convectively coupled tropical disturbances akin to the MJO whose formation and dynamics are linked to moisture perturbations—develop only when GMS is either negative or “effectively” negative when considering additional sources of moist entropy. These simplified models typically use a prescribed, time-independent GMS value. Limited work has been done to assess GMS and its connection to intraseasonal variability in full-physics general circulation models (GCMs).The time-mean and intraseasonal behavior of normalized GMS (NGMS) are examined in three pairs of GCMs to elucidate the possible importance of NGMS for the MJO. In each GCM pair, one member produces weak intraseasonal variability, while the other produces robust MJOs because of a change in the treatment of deep convection. A strong linear correlation between time-mean NGMS and MJO simulation skill is observed, such that GCMs with less positive NGMS produce improved MJO eastward propagation. The reduction in time-mean NGMS is primarily due to a sharp drop to negative values in the NGMS component related to vertical advection, while the horizontal advection component has a less clear relationship with MJO simulations. Intraseasonal fluctuations of anomalous NGMS modulate the magnitude of background NGMS but generally do not change the sign of background NGMS. NGMS declines ahead of peak MJO rainfall and increases during and after heaviest precipitation. Total NGMS fluctuates during MJO passage but remains positive, suggesting that other sources of moist entropy are required to generate an effectively negative NGMS.},

	abstract = {Abstract A seasonally independent index for monitoring the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is described. It is based on a pair of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the combined fields of near-equatorially averaged 850-hPa zonal wind, 200-hPa zonal wind, and satellite-observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data. Projection of the daily observed data onto the multiple-variable EOFs, with the annual cycle and components of interannual variability removed, yields principal component (PC) time series that vary mostly on the intraseasonal time scale of the MJO only. This projection thus serves as an effective filter for the MJO without the need for conventional time filtering, making the PC time series an effective index for real-time use. The pair of PC time series that form the index are called the Real-time Multivariate MJO series 1 (RMM1) and 2 (RMM2). The properties of the RMM series and the spatial patterns of atmospheric variability they capture are explored. Despite the fact that RMM1 and RMM2 describe evolution of the MJO along the equator that is independent of season, the coherent off-equatorial behavior exhibits strong seasonality. In particular, the northward, propagating behavior in the Indian monsoon and the southward extreme of convection into the Australian monsoon are captured by monitoring the seasonally independent eastward propagation in the equatorial belt. The previously described interannual modulation of the global variance of the MJO is also well captured. Applications of the RMM series are investigated. One application is through their relationship with the onset dates of the monsoons in Australia and India; while the onsets can occur at any time during the convectively enhanced half of the MJO cycle, they rarely occur during the suppressed half. Another application is the modulation of the probability of extreme weekly rainfall; in the “Top End” region around Darwin, Australia, the swings in probability represent more than a tripling in the likelihood of an upper-quintile weekly rainfall event from the dry to wet MJO phase.},

Given that model parameterizations represent this subgrid convection as a function of the large-scale atmospheric state, an understanding of the strongest relationships between the two scales is needed. This study introduces a method to create two concurrent long-term data sets that describe both the large-scale atmosphere and the characteristics of the small-scale convection. Important relationships between these two scales are then investigated. It is found that convective precipitation, through convective precipitation area, has the strongest relationship with dynamical variables such as moisture convergence and vertical velocity at midlevels. The magnitude of the fluctuations of convective strength about the mean is found to be anticorrelated with the strength of the large-scale variables, indicating a more stochastic behavior of tropical convection in weakly than strongly forced regimes, respectively. Atmospheric stability related variables are not found to be positively related to either convective precipitation area or convective precipitation intensity, which is often an assumption made in convective parameterization. On the contrary, in a more unstable atmosphere, there is lower convective precipitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Observations of individual convective clouds reveal an extraordinary degree of inhomogeneity, with much of the vertical transport accomplished by subcloud-scale drafts. In view of these observations, a representation of moist convective transports for use in large-scale models is constructed, in which the fundamental entities are these subcloud-scale drafts rather than the clouds themselves. The transport by these small-scale drafts is idealized as follows. Air from the subcloud layer is lifted to each level i between cloud base and the level of neutral buoyancy for undilute air. A fraction (ϵi) of the condensed water is then converted to precipitation, which falls and partially or completely evaporates in an unsaturated downdraft. The remaining cloudy air is then assumed to form a uniform spectrum of mixtures with environmental air at level i; these mixtures ascend or descend according to their buoyancy. The updraft mass fluxes Mi are represented as vertical velocities determined by the amount of convective available potential energy for undilute ascent to level i, multiplied by fractional areas σi, which are in turn determined in such a way as to drive the mass fluxes toward a state of quasi-equilibrium with the large-scale forcing. The downdraft mass fluxes are unique functions of the Mi, so that determination of the Mi closes the System. The main closure parameters in this scheme are the parcel precipitation efficiencies, ϵi, which determine the fraction of condensed water in a parcel lifted to level i that is converted to precipitation, and the fraction σis of precipitation that falls through unsaturated air. These may be specified as functions of altitude, temperature, adiabatic water content, and so on, and are regarded as explicitly determined by cloud microphysical processes. Specification of these parameters determines the vertical profiles of heating and moistening by cloud processes, given the large-scale (explicitly resolved) forcing. It is argued here that accurate calculation of the moistening by cumulus clouds cannot proceed without addressing the microphysics of precipitation formation, fallout, and reevaporation. One-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium experiment with this scheme produce reasonable profiles of buoyancy and relative humidity. When large-scale descent is imposed, a trade-cumulus regime is produced, including a trade inversion and mixing-line structure in the cloud layer.},

We show that this idea has led to fundamental misconceptions about this interaction, and offer an alternative paradigm, based on the idea that convection is nearly in statistical equilibrium with its environment. According to the alternative paradigm, the vertical temperature profile itself, rather than the heating, is controlled by the convection, which ties the temperature directly to the subcloud-layer entropy. The understanding of large-scale circulations in convecting atmospheres can, therefore, be regarded as a problem of understanding the distribution in space and time of the subcloud-layer entropy. We show that the subcloud-layer entropy is controlled by the sea surface temperature, the surface wind speed, and the large-scale vertical velocity in the convecting layer, and demonstrate how the recognition of this control leads to a simple, physically consistent view of large-scale flows, ranging from the Hadley and Walker circulations to the 30–50-day oscillation. In particular, we argue that the direct effect of convection on large-scale circulations is to reduce by roughly an order of magnitude the effective static stability felt by such circulations, and to damp all of them.},

Shallow convection moistens and cools the atmosphere, whereas deep convection dries and warms the atmosphere, leading to destabilization and stabilization, respectively. Consequently, in their own stand-alone modes, shallow convection perpetually grows, whereas deep convection simply damps: the former never reaches equilibrium, and the latter is never spontaneously generated. Coupling the modes together is the only way to reconcile these undesirable separate tendencies, so that the convective system as a whole can remain in a stable periodic state under this idealized setting. Such coupling is a key missing element in current global atmospheric models. The energy cycle description used herein is fully consistent with the original formulation by Arakawa and Schubert, and is suitable for direct implementation into models using a mass flux parameterization. The coupling would alleviate current problems with the representation of these two types of convection in numerical models. The present theory also provides a pertinent framework for analyzing large-eddy simulations and cloud-resolving modeling.},

	abstract = {A simple analytic model is constructed to elucidate some basic features of the response of the tropical atmosphere to diabatic heating. In particular, there is considerable east-west asymmetry which can be illustrated by solutions for heating concentrated in an area of finite extent. This is of more than academic interest because heating in practice tends to be concentrated in specific areas. For instance, a model with heating symmetric about the equator at Indonesian longitudes produces low-level easterly flow over the Pacific through propagation of Kelvin waves into the region. It also produces low-level westerly inflow over the Indian Ocean (but in a smaller region) because planetary waves propagate there. In the heating region itself the low-level flow is away from the equator as required by the vorticity equation. The return flow toward the equator is farther west because of planetary wave propagation, and so cyclonic flow is obtained around lows which form on the western margins of the heating zone. Another model solution with the heating displaced north of the equator provides a flow similar to the monsoon circulation of July and a simple model solution can also be found for heating concentrated along an inter-tropical convergence line.},

The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.},

The surface buoyancy gradients and ageostrophic secondary circulations intensify in response to the mesoscale strain field as predicted by the theory of filamentogenesis. It can be understood in terms of a dual frontogenetic process, along the lines understood for a single front. There is, however, a stronger secondary circulation due to the amplification at the center of a cold filament. Filament dynamics in the presence of a mixed layer are not adequately described by the classical thermal wind balance. The effect of vertical mixing of momentum due to turbulence in the surface layer is of the same order of magnitude as the pressure gradient and Coriolis force and contributes equally to a so-called turbulent thermal wind balance. Filamentogenesis is disrupted by vigorous submesoscale instabilities. The cause of the instability is the lateral shear as energy production by the horizontal Reynolds stress is the primary fluctuation source during the process; this contrasts with the usual baroclinic instability of submesoscale surface fronts. The filaments are lines of strong oceanic surface convergence as illustrated by the release of Lagrangian parcels in the Gulf Stream. Diabatic mixing is strong as parcels move across the filaments and downwell into the pycnocline. The life cycle of a filament is typically a few days in duration, from intensification to quasi stationarity to instability to dissipation.},

Cross-correlation analysis shows that the mean vertical velocity is an important indicator of deep convection. We show that, if conditioned on the mean vertical velocity, the Markov chains produce fractions comparable to the observations.

	abstract = {AbstractThe Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) skeleton model offers a theoretical prediction of the MJO’s structure. Here, a method is described for identifying this structure in observational data. The method utilizes projections onto equatorial wave structures, and a main question is: Can this method isolate the MJO without using temporal filtering or empirical orthogonal functions? For the data projection, a wide range of data is incorporated: multiple variables (wind, geopotential height, water vapor, and, as a proxy for convective activity, outgoing longwave radiation); multiple pressure levels (850 and 200 hPa); and multiple latitudes (both equatorial and off-equatorial). Such a data variety is combined using a systematic method, and it allows a distinction between the Kelvin and Rossby components of the MJO’s structure. Results are illustrated for some well-known cases, and statistical measures are presented to quantify the variability of the MJO skeleton signal, MJOS(x,t), and its amplitude, MJOSA(t). The robustness of the methods is demonstrated through a suite of sensitivity studies, including tests with two projection methods. When the projection is based on the skeleton model’s energy, as opposed to the standard L2 energy, water vapor is seen to be of primary importance. Finally, a simple interpretation is given for the MJO skeleton structure: it is related to the wave response to a moving heat source. From either perspective, the methods here identify signals that project onto coupled convection-circulation patterns; and the results suggest that a large portion of the MJO’s structure is consistent with such a coupled pattern.},

	abstract = {Abstract A theory for estimating the probability distribution of the state of a model given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory unifies the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem that have been key foci of prediction and predictability research for numerical weather and ocean prediction applications. A new algorithm, referred to as an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and the more traditional implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter in which “perturbed observations” are used, are derived as Monte Carlo approximations to the nonlinear filter. Both ensemble Kalman filter methods produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while providing reasonable measures of uncertainty in the assimilated variables. The ensemble methods can assimilate observations with a nonlinear relation to model state variables and can also use observations to estimate the value of imprecisely known model parameters. These ensemble filter methods are shown to have significant advantages over four-dimensional variational assimilation in low-order models and scale easily to much larger applications. Heuristic modifications to the filtering algorithms allow them to be applied efficiently to very large models by sequentially processing observations and computing the impact of each observation on each state variable in an independent calculation. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is applied to a nondivergent barotropic model on the sphere to demonstrate the capabilities of the filters in models with state spaces that are much larger than the ensemble size. When observations are assimilated in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, the resulting updated ensemble has a mean that is consistent with the value given by filtering theory, but only the expected value of the covariance of the updated ensemble is consistent with the theory. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter computes a linear operator that is applied to the prior ensemble estimate of the state, resulting in an updated ensemble whose mean and also covariance are consistent with the theory. In the cases compared here, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter performs significantly better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, apparently because noise introduced into the assimilated ensemble through perturbed observations in the traditional filter limits its relative performance. This superior performance may not occur for all problems and is expected to be most notable for small ensembles. Still, the results suggest that careful study of the capabilities of different varieties of ensemble Kalman filters is appropriate when exploring new applications.},

	abstract = {Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, the most important gaseous source of infrared opacity in the atmosphere. As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, increase because of human activity, it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected. To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world, the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified. Models of the Earth's climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks, and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered. Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback. Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing. The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is 1.5°C to 4.5°C. If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range, climate changes in the twenty-first century will be profound. The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earth's cloud distribution is maintained; all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback. If this feedback is, in fact, substantially weaker than predicted in current models, sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely, a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications. In this review, we describe the background behind the prevailing view on water vapor feedback and some of the arguments raised by its critics, and attempt to explain why these arguments have not modified the consensus within the climate research community.},

It is proposed that the cyclone develops by a kind of secondary instability in which existing cumulus convection is augmented in regions of low-level horizontal convergence and quenched in regions of low-level divergence. The cumulus- and cyclone-scale motions are thus to be regarded as cooperating rather than as competing–the clouds supplying latent heat energy to the cyclone, and the cyclone supplying the fuel, in the form of moisture, to the clouds. A scale-analysis indicates that it is appropriate to use the balance equations of Eliassen for the macro-motion; in this case the effect of friction in the boundary-layer may be incorporated as a condition on the vertical velocity at the top of the boundary layer. It is argued that the mean humidity in a system of convecting cumulus clouds in statistical equilibrium with the cyclone-scale circulation is appreciably less than its saturation value. The atmosphere is then gravitationally stable for the macro-scale convective process even though it is gravitationally unstable for the micro-scale convective process. The amplification of the disturbance is due to the surface frictionally induced convergence of moisture and liberation of latent heat in the center of the cyclone.},

	abstract = {Abstract A theory of the interaction of a cumulus cloud ensemble with the large-scale environment is developed. In this theory, the large-scale environment is divided into the subcloud mixed layer and the region above. The time changes of the environment are governed by the heat and moisture budget equations for the subcloud mixed layer and for the region above, and by a prognostic equation for the depth of the mixed layer. In the environment above the mixed layer, the cumulus convection affects the temperature and moisture fields through cumulus-induced subsidence and detrainment of saturated air containing liquid water which evaporates in the environment. In the subcloud mixed layer, the cumulus convection does not act directly on the temperature and moisture fields, but it affects the depth of the mixed layer through cumulus-induced subsidence. Under these conditions the problem of parameterization of cumulus convection reduces to the determination of the vertical distributions of the total vertical mass flux by the ensemble, the total detrainment of mass from the ensemble, and the thermodynamical properties of the detraining air. The cumulus ensemble is spectrally divided into sub-ensembles according to the fractional entrainment rate, given by the ratio of the entrainment per unit height to the vertical mass flux in the cloud. For these sub-ensembles, the budget equations for mass, moist static energy, and total water content are obtained. The solutions of these equations give the temperature excess, the water vapor excess, and the liquid water content of each sub-ensemble, and further reduce the problem of parameterization to the determination of the mass flux distribution function, which is the sub-ensemble vertical mass flux at the top of the mixed layer. The cloud work function, which is an integral measure of the buoyancy force in the clouds, is defined for each sub-ensemble; and, under the assumption that it is in quasi-equilibrium, an integral equation for the mass flux distribution function is derived. This equation describes how a cumulus ensemble is forced by large-scale advection, radiation, and surface turbulent fluxes, and it provides a closed parameterization of cumulus convection for use in prognostic models of large-scale atmospheric motion.},

	abstract = {AbstractA minimal, nonlinear oscillator model is analyzed for the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) “skeleton” (i.e., its fundamental features on intraseasonal/planetary scales), which includes the following: (i) a slow eastward phase speed of roughly 5 m s−1, (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dω/dk ≈ 0, and (iii) a horizontal quadrupole vortex structure. Originally proposed in recent work by the authors, the fundamental mechanism involves neutrally stable interactions between (i) planetary-scale, lower-tropospheric moisture anomalies and (ii) the envelope of subplanetary-scale, convection/wave activity. Here, the model’s nonlinear dynamics are analyzed in a series of numerical experiments, using either a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) or a warm-pool SST. With a uniform SST, the results show significant variations in the number, strength, and/or locations of MJO events, including, for example, cases of a strong MJO event followed by a weaker MJO event, similar to the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). With a warm-pool SST, MJO events often begin as standing oscillations and then propagate slowly eastward across the warm pool, a behavior imitating MJOs in nature. While displaying the fundamental features of the MJO skeleton, these MJO events had significant variations in their lifetimes and regional extents, and they displayed intense, irregular fluctuations in their amplitudes. The model reproduces all of these features of the MJO skeleton without including mechanisms for the MJO’s “muscle,” such as refined vertical structure and upscale convective momentum transport from subplanetary-scale convection/waves. Besides these numerical experiments, it is also shown that the nonlinear model conserves a total energy that includes a contribution from the convective activity.},

Despite the primary importance of the MJO and the decades of research progress since its original discovery, a generally accepted theory for its essential mechanisms has remained elusive. Here, we present a minimal dynamical model for the MJO that recovers robustly its fundamental features (i.e., its “skeleton”) on intraseasonal/planetary scales: (i) the peculiar dispersion relation of dω/dk ≈ 0, (ii) the slow phase speed of ≈5 m/s, and (iii) the horizontal quadrupole vortex structure. This is accomplished here in a model that is neutrally stable on planetary scales; i.e., it is tacitly assumed that the primary instabilities occur on synoptic scales. The key premise of the model is that modulations of synoptic scale wave activity are induced by low-level moisture preconditioning on planetary scales, and they drive the “skeleton” of the MJO through modulated heating. The “muscle” of the MJO—including tilts, vertical structure, etc.—is contributed by other potential upscale transport effects from the synoptic scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract A simple theoretical model of the deep stratification and meridional overturning circulation in an idealized single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing; predicts the deep stratification in terms of the surface forcing and other problem parameters; makes no assumption of zero residual circulation; and consistently accounts for the interaction between the circumpolar channel and the rest of the ocean. The theory shows that dynamics of the overturning circulation can be characterized by two limiting regimes, corresponding to weak and strong diapycnal mixing. The transition between the two regimes is described by a nondimensional number characterizing the strength of the diffusion-driven compared to the wind-driven overturning circulation. In the limit of weak diapycnal mixing, deep stratification throughout the ocean is produced by the effects of wind and eddies in a circumpolar channel and maintained even in the limit of vanishing diapycnal diffusivity and in a flat-bottomed ocean. The overturning circulation across the deep stratification is driven by the diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel but is sensitive, through changes in stratification, to the wind and eddies in the channel. In the limit of strong diapycnal mixing, deep stratification is primarily set by eddies in the channel and diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel, with the wind over the circumpolar channel playing a secondary role. Analytical solutions for the deep stratification and overturning circulation in the limit of weak diapycnal mixing and numerical solutions that span the regimes of weak to strong diapycnal mixing are presented. The theory is tested with a coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model configured in an idealized geometry. A series of experiments performed to examine the sensitivity of the deep stratification and the overturning circulation to variations in wind stress and diapycnal mixing compare well with predictions from the theory.},

Despite the primary importance of the MJO and the decades of research progress since its original discovery, a generally accepted theory for its essential mechanisms has remained elusive. In recent work by two of the authors, a minimal dynamical model has been proposed that recovers robustly the most fundamental MJO features of (i) a slow eastward speed of roughly 5 m s−1, (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dω/dk ≈ 0, and (iii) a horizontal quadrupole vortex structure. This model, the skeleton model, depicts the MJO as a neutrally stable atmospheric wave that involves a simple multiscale interaction between planetary dry dynamics, planetary lower-tropospheric moisture, and the planetary envelope of synoptic-scale activity. In this article, it is shown that the skeleton model can further account for (iv) the intermittent generation of MJO events and (v) the organization of MJO events into wave trains with growth and demise, as seen in nature. The goal is achieved by developing a simple stochastic parameterization for the unresolved details of synoptic-scale activity, which is coupled to otherwise deterministic processes in the skeleton model. In particular, the intermittent initiation, propagation, and shut down of MJO wave trains in the skeleton model occur through these stochastic effects. This includes examples with a background warm pool where some initial MJO-like disturbances propagate through the western region but stall at the peak of background convection/heating corresponding to the Maritime Continent in nature.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

The circulation exhibits intraseasonal variability on a time scale of about 20 days with quasi-periodic intensification of the circulation and broadening of the convective regime. This variability is closely tied to synoptic-scale systems associated with expansion and contraction of the Walker circulation. An index for the low-frequency variability is developed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and by regressing various dynamic fields on this index. The low-frequency oscillation has four main stages: a suppressed stage with strengthened midlevel circulation, an intensification phase, an active phase with strong upper-level circulation, and a weakening phase. Various physical processes occurring at these stages are discussed as well as the impact of organized convective systems on the large-scale flow.},

This observational analysis elucidates several key features of these waves including their propagation speed of roughly 15 m s−1 and many aspects of their dynamical structure. This structure includes anomalously cold temperatures in the lower troposphere and warm temperatures in the upper troposphere (below 250 hPa) within and sometimes leading the heating region and strong updrafts in the wave, and an upward and westward tilting structure with height below roughly 250 hPa. Other key features in the wave are that anomalous increases in convective available potential energy (CAPE) and surface precipitation lead the wave while the trailing part of the supercluster is dominated by stratiform precipitation. The main result in this paper is the development of a simple model convective parameterization with nonlinear convectively coupled moist gravity waves, which reproduce many of the features of the observational record listed above in a qualitative fashion. One key feature of the model convective parameterization is the systematic use of two vertical modes with one representing deep convective heating and the other stratiform heating. The other key feature in the model is the explicit parameterization of the separate deep convective and stratiform contribution to the downdrafts, which change equivalent potential temperature in the boundary layer. The effects of rotation on convectively coupled equatorial waves are also included through a suitable linear stability theory for the model convective parameterization about radiative convective equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Abstract A review of the cumulus parameterization problem is presented with an emphasis on its conceptual aspects covering the history of the underlying ideas, major problems existing at present, and possible directions and approaches for future climate models. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, there have been decades of controversies in posing the cumulus parameterization problem. In this paper, it is suggested that confusion between budget and advection considerations is primarily responsible for the controversies. It is also pointed out that the performance of parameterization schemes can be better understood if one is not bound by their authors' justifications. The current trend in posing cumulus parameterization is away from deterministic diagnostic closures, including instantaneous adjustments, toward prognostic or nondeterministic closures, including relaxed and/or triggered adjustments. A number of questions need to be answered, however, for the merit of this trend to be fully utilized. Major practical and conceptual problems in the conventional approach of cumulus parameterization, which include artificial separations of processes and scales, are then discussed. It is rather obvious that for future climate models the scope of the problem must be drastically expanded from “cumulus parameterization” to “unified cloud parameterization,” or even to “unified model physics.” This is an extremely challenging task, both intellectually and computationally, and the use of multiple approaches is crucial even for a moderate success. “Cloud-resolving convective parameterization” or “superparameterization” is a promising new approach that can develop into a multiscale modeling framework (MMF). It is emphasized that the use of such a framework can unify our currently diversified modeling efforts and make verification of climate models against observations much more constructive than it is now.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity analysis of resting state blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is widely used for noninvasively studying brain functional networks. Recent findings have indicated, however, that even small (≤1 mm) amounts of head movement during scanning can disproportionately bias connectivity estimates, despite various preprocessing efforts. Further complications for interregional connectivity estimation from time domain signals include the unaccounted reduction in BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from high subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear echo-time dependence of signals—a characteristic property of BOLD signal changes. Here we show for 32 control subjects that this method provides a physically principled and nearly operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as motion from resting state data. We then describe a robust estimator of functional connectivity based on interregional correlation of BOLD-independent component coefficients. This estimator, called independent components regression, considerably simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity because degrees of freedom equals the number of independent coefficients. Compared with traditional connectivity estimation methods, the proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements in signal-to-noise ratio, functional connectivity analysis with improved specificity, and valid statistical inference with nominal control of type 1 error in contrasts of connectivity between groups with different levels of subject motion.},

	abstract = {The method by which an ocean, initially stratified but motionless, adjusts to a suddenly applied wind stress is examined. For wind stress in the east-west direction, the zonal velocity in the ocean interior builds up linearly with time until a long planetary wave arrives from the eastern boundary. Then the interior flow stops increasing and oscillates about a steady value. At the west, a boundary layer forms and gets progressively thinner. The rate of thinning of this boundary layer is reduced by the arrival of long planetary waves from the east but is not stopped. A comparison is made between the barotropic and baroclinic responses.

A comparison is also made between the upwelling at the eastern boundary induced by a longshore wind stress when there are no planetary waves (f-plane) and when there are planetary waves (ß-plane). In the former, upwelling is restricted to within a distance of ∼ 3 km of the coast, whereas when planetary waves are included the width of the upwelling zone increases with time. On both f- and ß-plane, Kelvin waves carry energy poleward along the eastern boundary. For a wind stress which varies sinusoidally with y this results in the mean upwelling being nearly 90° out of phase with the wind stress. The amplitude of the Kelvin wave is damped on the ß-plane but suffers no attenuation on the f-plane. The difference between the results for coastal upwelling on an f-plane and that on a ß-plane increases as the north-south scale of the forcing is increased. In the case where the scale is infinite, the f-plane upwelling increases indefinitely with time whereas the ß-plane solution attains a steady value.},

	abstract = {Convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs) control a substantial fraction of tropical rainfall variability. Their horizontal structures and dispersion characteristics correspond to Matsuno's (1966) solutions of the shallow water equations on an equatorial beta plane, namely, Kelvin, equatorial Rossby, mixed Rossby-gravity, and inertio-gravity waves. Because of moist processes, the tilted vertical structures of CCEWs are complex, and their scales do not correspond to that expected from the linear theory of dry waves. The dynamical structures and cloud morphology of CCEWs display a large degree of self-similarity over a surprisingly wide range of scales, with shallow convection at their leading edge, followed by deep convection and then stratiform precipitation, mirroring that of individual mesoscale convective complexes. CCEWs have broad impacts within the tropics, and their simulation in general circulation models is still problematic, although progress has been made using simpler models. A complete understanding of CCEWs remains a challenge in tropical meteorology.},

	abstract = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, (including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws). These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. The methods were orginally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-progagation problems, particulary in heterogenous material. The methods studied are in the CLAWPACK software package. Source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

Despite recent major improvements in the efficiency of the SSA, its drawback remains the great amount of computer time that is often required to simulate a desired amount of system time. Presented here is the “τ-leap” method, an approximate procedure that in some circumstances can produce significant gains in simulation speed with acceptable losses in accuracy. Some primitive strategies for control parameter selection and error mitigation for the τ-leap method are described, and simulation results for two simple model systems are exhibited. With further refinement, the τ-leap method should provide a viable way of segueing from the exact SSA to the approximate chemical Langevin equation, and thence to the conventional deterministic reaction rate equation, as the system size becomes larger.},

	abstract = {A new way to parametrize certain aspects of tropical convection through stochastic and mesoscopic models is developed here. The technical idea is to adapt tools from statistical physics and materials science to model important unresolved features of tropical convection. This new strategy consists of modeling the unresolved effects of convective inhibition in a coarse mesh mesoscopic parametrization through a “heat bath” model involving a stochastic spin flip model with very natural interaction rules for convective inhibition combined with a suitable external potential defined by the coarse mesh values. In turn, the values of the order parameter from this heat bath alter the vertical mass flux in regions of deep convection. Both stochastic and systematic deterministic mesoscopic parametrizations are developed here. The deterministic mesoscopic models derived in this fashion exhibit new phenomena such as multiple radiative equilibria in suitable parameter regimes. The simplest first numerical experiments reported here with the mesoscopic deterministic parametrization qualitatively reproduce several key features of the observational record regarding convectively coupled tropical waves. The systematic stochastic modeling strategy proposed here could also be very useful for capturing other features of tropical convection such as those involving cloud radiation feedbacks.},
